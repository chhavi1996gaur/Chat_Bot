2410,49542,Lack of action taken by landlord against a noisy neighbor,"(First time posting on this SE, I hope it's not off-topic.)

I have a friend who lives in the Netherlands, let's call her Allison. Both her and her neighbor (let's call him Bob) live in an apartment complex owned by a therapy organization they are both patients at, and their landlord is also the owner of said organization. Bob has lived there longer than Allison.

Every once in a while (at least once a week, though sometimes a lot more often), Bob tends to be very noisy in his apartment, by listening to loud music or playing with a pinball machine (a physical, real life one, not a video game). This often also happens very late at night, which is obviously not allowed per contract, and the walls are incredibly thin. Allison has complained about this numerous times, as it prevents her from sleeping at night and her mental health is suffering because of it, which the therapy home was supposed to be helping with. The inhabitants of the other apartments don't hear any noise, as Allison's apartment is the only one that share's a wall with Bob's.

The problem: Since Bob is a therapy patient himself, the landlord and the therapists appear to be protective of him. Supposedly, he has his own baggage that prevents him from noticing, caring or remembering that he's being inconsiderate. While they don't explicitly condone him doing this at night, they barely take any direct action. Instead, they advised Allison to use earplugs, since the person who lived in her apartment before her never complained about this and they figured she may just be too sensitive. When the earplugs didn't help, they told her to message Bob whenever he's being too loud, because he apparently needs constant reminding that he's not supposed to do this after a certain time of day. Allison tried this, and it helped, but the silence usually only persists for a few minutes before being broken again.

On Allison's request, the landlord eventually agreed to order noise cancelling panels to be installed on the wall between their apartments. However, he only agreed to pay for the very cheapest ones available, which had to be shipped from China and are now being withheld due to the Corona virus. Furthermore, after it was clarified that these panels would need to be installed on Bob's side of the wall in order to have any effect, Bob suddenly expressed that he's not willing to put in the effort to do so. In other words, he refuses to actively do something to fix the problem he's causing, despite the panels being gifted to him (Allison has expressed willingness to invest into panels for her side of the wall out of her own pocket, just for added sound isolation, but as stated earlier, those won't do much on their own).

Recently, Allison's therapist started encouraging her to look for other apartments, all of which turned out to be substantially more expensive than her current one (given similar size and quality). Despite knowing that Allison's financial situation isn't the best, her therapist kept suggesting that it might be worth it to get some peaceful nights. Allison feels like this is rather unfair, like she's being punished for her neighbor breaking the contract and keeping her up at night, and that the landlord / therapy organization should put more effort into solving this for her, as the contract states that excessive noise at night is grounds for eviction. However, whenever she brings these arguments up, they keep getting dodged.

Allison tried contacting the police about this, but they dismissed her case as something that's out of their reach. They advised her to try something called a ""neighborhood mediation"", though Allison has strong doubts about the usefulness of such a thing, as the landlord and therapists have already tried mediating between the two of them.

Question: Is there any other way to resolve this issue? Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one? And if not, how does one get him to take action?
",49557,"
  Can a therapy organization get away with catering to one patient's needs, despite that being extremely counterproductive to the needs of another patient, especially if the former is the one breaking the rules? Is it legal for the landlord to blatantly ignore a contract that was signed by all the involved parties and not take any action against one of these parties breaking it and strongly inconveniencing another one?


First, it is important for Allison to distinguish between the existing legal relations and each one's separate ramifications.

The therapist looks manipulative and dishonest when encouraging Allison to rent a more expensive place, since at this point it seems that the therapist knew or should have known that the situation involves the landlord (who coincidentally is the therapist's employer). At the very least, the therapist should have informed Allison that the therapist has a potential conflict of interest, and thus let Allison decide whether or not to rely on that organization's services. Here, the therapist failed to make due disclosure.

Instead, the therapist's acts have all the appearance of accommodating its other customer (Bob), and ultimately trying not to disrupt its employer's profits both as landlord and as therapy business owner. That conflict of interest sounds in therapist's malpractice and may even amount to [therapist's &amp; company's] fraud.

Regardless of whether Allison chooses to denounce the therapist and/or the business, she should ask herself whether a therapy organization with such practices is apt for continued treatment of --and the ensuing profits from-- Allison's therapy needs. One aspect Allison needs to consider is that her continued business there would weaken her arguments if she eventually brings court proceedings against the therapist or his employer.

Allison's tenancy is a separate issue. Allison knows better than I (and the public in general) the terms of her lease and the physical details of her residential unit, so only she can compare them with section 7.4.2 of the Burgerlijke Wetboek to assess whether the lack of quiet enjoyment is attributable to a defect of the leased property (article 7:204.2). Allison should assess this issue from the standpoint of landlord's possible allegation that """"the disturbance is caused by a third person"" (whereby the landlord would seek to avoid liability under 7:204.3). Depending on Allison's determination of the aforementioned issue, she would have a claim against the landlord for breach of contract, and/or against Bob for tortious conduct (6:162).

There are at least three reasons why Allison should follow the police's suggestion of neighborhood mediation. The first reason is that there has been essentially no mediation in Allison's dispute. Mediation requires a nonparty whose neutrality is not compromised when conducting the mediation. That has been missing here so far. Allison has only dealt with third parties (i.e., the landlord and therapists) who are first and foremost reluctant to inconvenience their noisy client Bob for fear of affecting their own business interests. Allison's belief that these people were conducting a form of mediation is mistaken.

The second reason is that, from mediation, Allison may pursue and obtain a written &amp; signed agreement whereby Bob promises to desist from his pattern of disturbances (ideally Allison would secure an akin sort of commitment also from the landlord). In the event that Allison subsequently needs to sue either or both of the parties for the continued disturbances, filing in court these binding documents (which she would have obtained through mediation) will ease Allison's burden of proof.

The third reason is that genuine mediation might obviate Allison's need to seek remedies in court. That is because it would teach both landlord and Bob that Allison is able and willing to take legal action if the situation persists or escalates, which might have a dissuading effect on them. Furthermore, mediation proceedings will give Allison some experience as to presenting her legal arguments in a more formal setting.

Courts in Netherlands may grant injunctive relief in situations like Allison's where the ongoing harm is not susceptible of being quantified in monetary terms. Allison may pursue that relief, which if granted would compel the police to enforce it each time Bob violates it.
",Accepted,"Arkansas does not appear to have its own version of the FMLA. Whether or not the FMLA applies to your friend's employer is a complex question related to other local businesses that may or may not be integrated with the franchise within which he works. It would require the knowledge of a local labor attorney and knowledge of the business structure of the franchisee to make a determination. 

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA - Department of Labor site) applies to employers with 50 or more employees within 75 miles of the employee's worksite.

Generally, franchise operations are independent businesses and the individual business would need to meet the employee count threshold for its employees to be covered.

However, there is the concept of an ""integrated employer."" The Labor Department sometimes groups smaller businesses as an integrated employer and this will cause the FMLA to apply to seemingly independent businesses with fewer than 50 employees.

The Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division lays out four factors to determine if the businesses are integrated:


  
  interrelation of operations, i.e., common offices, common record keeping, shared bank accounts and equipment;
  common management, common directors and boards;
  centralized control of labor relations and personnel, i.e., hire and fire employees; and,
  common ownership and financial control
  


They further state:


  A determination of whether or not separate entities are an integrated
  employer is not determined by the application of any single criterion,
  but rather the entire relationship is to be reviewed in its totality.
  All four criteria need not be present in all cases, but the Equal
  Employment Opportunity Commission, which administers the Civil Rights
  Act, considers the first three criteria to be the most important, with
  centralized control of labor relations to be most critical of these
  three.


A fast food franchise would not be subject to FMLA regulations because the franchisor is a large company. However, many fast food franchises are part of larger, local businesses such as restaurant groups that may be subject to the regulations.

An example of this would be Christopher Harold who owned Sofono, Inc, a company established to own three Domino's Pizza franchises. In Cousin v. Sofono, an employee sued to recognize that the FMLA applied to these businesses because they were an ""integrated employer."" There is an article in Business Management Daily that discusses the case and the appeal of the case can be found here.

Whether or not the fast food franchise where your friend works would qualify as an integrated employer with other fast food franchises is subject to an examination of the business structure of the individual employers. If the franchise is truly a stand-alone business with fewer than 50 employees then the FMLA would not apply. In the case of the Domino's pizza franchise they were deemed to be integrated because they were the same franchise licensees of the same franchisor (Domino's) and they had a common workers' comp policy.

Do be aware that the 50 employee limit is not a permanent employee threshold. From The Employer's Guide to The Family and Medical Leave Act:


  A private-sector employer is covered by the FMLA if it employs 50 or
  more employees in 20 or more workweeks in the current or previous
  calendar year.


The example they give in the guide is an employer that hires temporary, seasonal workers causing the employer to qualify under FMLA.

The integrated employer test and how to count employees can be found in the regulations regarding FMLA.

",49604,"Lawsuits are only allowed for harms to a particular private individual's health that actually arises from the conduct of the person sued. You can't sue because there was an outbreak in your city, you have to show individualized harm to you.

To prevail you would have to make out a ""negligence"" claim. The elements of this claim are (1) a duty, (2) that was breached, (3) by someone with injuries, (4) that were caused by the breach of duty.

There are two kinds of duties. One is the general duty to use the care of a reasonable person to prevent foreseeable harm to others (a breach of this duty is called ""negligence""). The other is to obey statutes and regulations and ordinances intended to protect people like the person injured from the harm suffered.

If someone doesn't violate a statute, regulation, or ordinance, then one has to show that it as negligent to carry out the event.

There would also be an affirmative defense that the fault was entirely that of the victim by attending the event knowing of the risk.

I wouldn't rule out negligence liability for event organizers, but it is more likely that they would be sued not for holding the event, but for failure to use reasonable care in how it was conducted (e.g. not having face masks and hand sanitizer on hand).

",49863,"Communicable diseases are endemic to the human condition

Some places, times and situations are riskier than others but there is always a risk in widespread travel. Outside of disease spread, there are other risks in travel; for example, if no-one traveled at all there would be no motor vehicle deaths.

On the flip-side, not traveling has its own dangers; for example, you will not die in a house fire if you are in your car.

Of course, there are enormous benefits to widespread travel;  economic, cultural and personal - life is to be experienced after all.

If you stop the skier from skiing, then you have just damaged the livelihood of all the people who depend on tourism; the airline, the hotel, the bartender, the ski technician, the baker in the ski resort etc.

Everything is allowed unless it is prohibited

By and large, this is the way that the law works. It's legal to do anything you like. Unless it isn't.

It isn't illegal to travel to, say, Finland. So you can.

If the government (of whichever country) decides that the costs of allowing people to travel to Finland now outweigh the benefits then they can prohibit it. However, that is a political decision; not a legal one.

As for your drink-driving example, I am old enough to remember when it wasn't illegal to drive drunk, although I was too young to drive. Of course, if you are in Somalia or Kenya it's still legal. Also, what counts a drunk varies by country - you can have a couple in Finland but cross over into Russia and you are breaking the law. Why does Finland allow such recklessness? Because it's a political decision and politicians in Finland and Russia have reached different conclusions about what level of risk is acceptable. Same with travel restrictions.

  People will be allowed to cross the Czech borders with Germany and Austria only at selected crossings as of Friday midnight, with border checks being reintroduced, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (Social Democrats, CSSD) said.

  Reinforcing health measures at the Schengen Borders
  Under the Schengen Border Code, all decisions to refuse or accept entry to the territory of a Member State must be subject to an individual assessment undertaken by the competent authorities. It is the responsibility of the Member States to refuse entry on public health grounds to individual third country nationals.


Based on Czech and EU laws, no Czech judge should have any objections about these measures. 

From the comments:


  
    This requires some fairly specific government rulings to reduce travelling. A priori citizens are free to travel pretty much anywhere. If for example I travel within Germany to the most affected county and then back to a major metro area, one could argue that I'm not very responsible but unless either me or the county are officially quarantined, I'm not liable for anything.
  


In this case home quarantine for two weeks is mandatory and can be fined with € 115240,50.

There is no need for you to ""consent"".

Consent is just one of the reasons that allows a data processor to collect your data. There are other reasons that allows the data processor to capture your data.

In this case, it seems of application the ""legitimate interest clause"", as it is in your university's legitimate interest to capture your activity in order to evaluate you.

Of course, that covers only the data collected that is relevant to that interest. They will certainly capture your identity and your answers, they may log your sessions and may try to gather some data to detect if you are somehow cheating, but they would not be allowed to check which are your favorite pornhub videos because that is not relevant for the university's legitimate interest.

Art. 6 of the GDPR states:


  Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:
  (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
  (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
  (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
  (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
  (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
  (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

",Accepted,"In Canada as in the US, truth is a defence against defamation. Additionally, if the plaintiff makes the statement, then the defendant didn't, and the plaintiff would have no basis for pursuing a person who managed to get him to defame himself. If the people were to accuse the person of committing a crime (sex with a minor), then the potential for defamation exists, if that accusation was communicated to a third person (excluding police -- you can accuse a person to the police). In that case, the defendants might attempt to prove that the accusation was true, but I don't know how they would show that. If all they could do is prove that the guy acted kind of pervey but that actually accused him of having sex with a minor, then they would probably be in legal hot water. If they accuse him of doing what he actually did, that is not defamation. There is no law against getting a person to publicly admit to wrong-doing. ""Entrapment"" is something that only law enforcement can do (and it's illegal).

Since it is not illegal in Canada for a person to offer sex for money (it is illegal to be a customer, though), the youths are not doing anything illegal. In the US, though, that would be illegal, so they too might get in trouble.

Context: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1)(b)
What is the legal basis for processing?

GDPR Art 6(1) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.
What is the minimal data necessary to achieve the purpose?

Per the Art 5(1)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide data protection by design and by default per Art 25. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.
What appropriate safeguards and security measures should you apply?

Per Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.
What further compliance measures do you have to consider?

There are additional GDPR and non-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:


Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13.
Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35. 
If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a joint controller or data processor and apply appropriate safeguards.
If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3).
If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.
If you transfer data into a non-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45. For US-based companies, this is the case only when they have self-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.


Non-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.
How can you prepare for data subject requests?

Data subjects have various rights per Arts 15–23, subject to the modalities in Art 12. For example, a data subject could request that their information is erased from your website. The exact rights also depend on the legal basis you selected. You should figure out in advance how to deal with such requests.

A lawyer is considered an ""officer of the court"" in the sense that certain duties to the court are imposed on the lawyer. That does not give the lawyer authority as if the lawyer was part of the court staff, nor a law enforcement officer.

A statement can be prosecuted as perjury only if it is made under oath (or affirmation) in court, or if it is made ""under penalty of perjury"". This is generally done by a statement in a document signed, something like ""I declare under penalty of perjury that all statements in the above document are true to the best of my knowledge and belief."" It can also be done verbally, with the person making the statement agreeing that it is true and that this is subject to perjury prosecution if it is false. The exact wording will vary, but it must be clear and explicit.

Aside from that, false statements to a lawyer are not generally subject to prosecution for perjury, nor otherwise illegal. In some cases a lie in a business transaction may be fraud, which is actionable, and possibly criminal. But that will not have anything to do with whether the person lied to is or is not a lawyer.

This Wikipedia article says:


  Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding.


...


  The rules for perjury also apply when a person has made a statement under penalty of perjury even if the person has not been sworn or affirmed as a witness before an appropriate official. An example is the US income tax return, which, by law, must be signed as true and correct under penalty of perjury  


The US Federal law on perjury, 18 U.S. Code § 1621 says:


  (1) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or
  
  (2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;
  
  is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.


Title 9 of the Maryland code, section 9-101 says:


  (a)  Prohibited.- A person may not willfully and falsely make an oath or affirmation as to a material fact: 
  
  (1) if the false swearing is perjury at common law; 
  
  (2) in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local law; 
  
  (3) in an affidavit made to induce a court or officer to pass an account or claim; 
  
  (4) in an affidavit required by any state, federal, or local government or governmental official with legal authority to require the issuance of an affidavit; or 
  
  (5) in an affidavit or affirmation made under the Maryland Rules. 
  
  (b)  Penalty.- A person who violates this section is guilty of the misdemeanor of perjury and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.  


Nothing about statements made to a lawyer not under oath or affirmation, or under penalty of perjury. Other US state laws are similar.

4379,50104,Breaking a lease before move in amidst Coronavirus concerns,"About a month ago, I signed a lease for an apartment (with two roommates who are renewing their lease) in North Carolina with a move-in date of May 15th. I'm a STEM graduate student, and with developing family finance concerns and the recent transition to remote everything both teaching and research related, I'm beginning to think it may not makes sense to drain so much of my income to stay near a closed university rather than move in with my brother.

To my reading, the lease agreement states that breaking with more than 6 months remaining will incur a penalty of 2 months' rent. Were I to attempt to back out in the next few days (well before the move-in date), could I expect the current national or state declaration of a state of emergency due to the Covid-19 pandemic to impact my penalty? In particular, is there any legal reason to expect that, due to the state of emergency, I could avoid the penalty altogether?
",50105,"In general, you are not freed of contractual obligations if your circumstances change, whether that is because of economic downturn / unemployment, weather, or disease. If there is a clause in the lease saying ""this lease can be voided if tenant {becomes unemployed / contracts a disease....}"" then that could cover your circumstances (I would be stunned if there were such a clause). There is a separate question, whether an exemption might arise if the government forbids you to move. The existence of a legal ""state of emergency"" has limited implications for legal rights and obligations – mostly, it empowers the government to restrict your rights. There is no effect on your responsibilities.

4381,50122,Do the German contact restrictions prohibit any form of celebrating?,"In response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus, Germany has enacted a general ""ban on contact"", effective starting today (Monday, 2020-03-23). It prohibits any gathering of more than two people in public and private spaces, except if they live in the same household.

What I am very unclear about is the extent to which certain behaviours are restricted by this regulation, as coverage in news is IMHO extremely unclear.

For instance, Berliner Morgenpost says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen auf öffentlichen Plätzen, in Wohnungen sowie privaten Einrichtungen sind angesichts der ernsten Lage in unserem Land inakzeptabel.


In English:


  Groups of partying people in public spaces, in apartments, as well as private facilities are inacceptable due to the serious situation in our country.


Tagesschau says:


  Gruppen feiernder Menschen - auch im Privaten - sind inakzeptabel


In English:


  Groups of celebrating people - also in private - are inacceptable


And Merkur.de says:


  „Gruppen feiernder Menschen sind inakzeptabel“, erklärten die Politiker unisono. Jegliche Feierlichkeiten sind untersagt, das gilt auch für Geburtstage.


In English:


  ""Groups of celebrating people are inacceptable."", the politicians explained in unison. Any kind of celebrations are prohibited, this includes birthdays.


Now, what does this mean? At least some of the above statements can be interpreted in such a way that it's about the physically close group aspect. That is, celebrations whose participants meet in person in the same place are prohibited.

But then, all of those statements, and definitely the last one, also sound a lot like it's the very activity of celebrating that is prohibited, presumably because the ""serious situation in our country"" makes such a behaviour unbecoming. Thus, it sounds like restrictions similar to the Tanzverbot (that declare various overtly joyful activities to be unbecoming and thus unlawful on certain holidays) are in place.

Which interpretation is correct?


Am I violating the newly imposed restrictions if I meet with some of my friends (each of which is sitting at home alone, or at most with their families) via videochat and ""celebrate"" (whatever is meant by that, let's count any joyful or relaxing leisure activity) with them online to brace against the effects of social isolation and cabin fever?
And does it mean we cannot let our children have a joyful videochat with their friends whom they already cannot meet in person due to the closure of schools and child nurseries?

",50123,"What most of your quotes are based on is this general consensus reached by the federal and state governments on how to proceed.
The actually legal implementation happens on the state level in form of decrees.
Therefore, the quoted texts are not to be taken as legal text, but human-readable¹. In particular they are not to be taken painstakingly literal, but context and common sense may be applied².

The actual decrees are much more specific and clear.
For example, let’s take the decree for Northrhine-Westphalia (translation mine):


  § 11 Veranstaltungen, Versammlungen, Gottesdienste, Beerdigungen
  
  (1) Veranstaltungen und Versammlungen sind untersagt. Ausgenommen sind […]
  
  § 12 Ansammlungen, Aufenthalt im öffentlichen Raum
  
  (1) Zusammenkünfte und Ansammlungen in der Öffentlichkeit von mehr als 2 Personen sind untersagt. Ausgenommen sind […]
  
  
  
  § 11 Events, gatherings, religious services, funerals
  
  (1) Events and gatherings are forbidden. Exempt are […]
  
  § 12 Gatherings and presence in public space
  
  (1) Congregations and gatherings of more than two persons in public are forbidden. Exempt from this are […]


Most of this is clearly about in-person meetings.
The only exception is the term “Veranstaltung” (event), which could be construed to cover online events.
However, in other laws using this term, it clearly refers to in-person events.
For example parts of this law governing the number of toilets available at an event do not make any sense for online events.

I see nothing in the decree that would forbid online celebrations. In fact celebrations are not mentioned at all (and are covered by more general terms in the degree, as far as they are in-person).




¹ To be fair, the actual legal texts are not that bad in terms in human readability either.
² Mind that I do not wish to accuse you of lacking common sense here. After all the consensus dissonating with your common sense made you ask this question.

Force majeure does not change contract terms (e.g. making a non-refundable deposit refundable). Rather, it allows parties to get away with not performing their obligations where circumstances beyond their control prevent them from doing so.

In your situation, all parties have performed their obligations so far. You paid the required deposit, they welcome you on the 1st of April.

It would therefore be much more likely that they get away with not refunding you a refundable deposit (if there was one) because of COVID-19 — than you get back the non-refundable one.

My employer informed my coworkers and I in a group meeting on the day before the lay-off that we would all be brought back to work when it is safe to do so.

If my employer was to not bring me back to work after the outbreak is over, perhaps citing a work performance issue or something along those lines, can I sue them for wrongful termination after they verbally promised all of us that we would all have our jobs after the Coronavirus outbreak is over?

There is a legal concept of promissory estoppel which boils down to promises being binding. However, there has to be a clear and definite promise, not for example a statement like ""we hope to bring you back after this is over"". 

Normally, the employer can argue that they have the right to fire you regardless of performance, and that would be the end of it. Let's say you have it in writing, and it is clear that they unconditionally promise to hire you back: you would want to (e)stop them from arguing that they have the right to fire you. The underlying idea of promissory estoppel is that such a promise keeps them from making that argument. But: it is not enough that they made the promise, you also had to rely on the promise and act / forbear from acting in some way because of that promise. It could be, for example, taking another job, or moving to another country, or simply looking for another job. The hard part, then, would be getting a clear and definite promise.

  In the state of California, how could one find out if a commercial
  company had ever sued another company?


The search is complex because there is no ""one-stop shop"" for this.

To search in federal court, go to pacer.gov.

To search in state trial court, contact the court of your county and ask whether it has a site for online case search. Other counties nearby might be using the same provider. For instance, the Washtenaw (in Michigan) county trial court gives public access to cases register of actions. Knowing that, it was easier for me to identify the analog for Wayne and Oakland counties. But Jackson county used a different provider. Likewise, California courts might be using Odyssey or other providers. There is no uniformity on this.

Keep in mind that an entity might have been involved in small claims court, which will not necessarily be reflected on the same site of county trial court.

To search for cases by party in California courts of appeal and supreme court, see here (the form to enter party appears after clicking on Search).

To search in the SCOTUS, see here.

Each court has its own policies for ordering records of the proceedings.

Leagle.com only displays decisions/opinions from appellate courts, supreme courts, and federal district courts. No litigation records are available from there. From personal experience as pro se litigant, I warn you that whatever you read in a court opinion does not necessarily reflect the actual evidence and arguments a party offered. Unfortunately, many courts are fond of distorting the record of a case for the sake of forcing an unlawful outcome.

Also beware that not all litigation happens in courts. A company could have gone through some Alternative Dispute Resolution method such as mediation or arbitration that might be of your interest nonetheless. Those proceedings would not be reflected in court sites unless at least one party escalates the issue (example: a party might appeal an arbitrator's ruling).

You don’t book with Expedia

Expedia is an aggregation service provider, they put you in touch with the supplier (who pays them) for you to book with. They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.

So, no matter what, you can’t get your money from them.

What does the contract say?

We have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and why Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... 

As an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree

The first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund - that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, “we can fly you tomorrow” - they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don’t want to fly tomorrow. Legally, this is fine, commercially, it would be a disaster.

Force Majeure

This obscure area of contract law has become very relevant at this time. It means “superior force” and deals with what happens when a party is unable to fulfil its obligations under a contract through unforeseen in the contract and unforeseeable in practice events beyond either parties control. That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?

If the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under? You’ll have to read it.

To help clarify my inquiry, what I particularly would like to know is if you are directed to exit your vehicle by a state trooper at this highway checkpoint so a doctor/nurse there can administer a test on you to see if you have COVID-19, can you decline to exit your vehicle and also decline undergoing this medical test? Do Americans have a Constitutional right to decline complying with such a directive?
",50343,"It is difficult to keep track of the rapidly changing legal variables, but it would be illegal and unconstitutional for state police to set up an unauthorized stop-and-search checkpoint on the road (""due process"" means ""following the law"").

You would have to scrutinize the emergency powers legislation of every state to be certain, but no governor has the power to mandate blanket body searches in case of a medical emergency. (Martial law shifts enforcement of the law to the military, but doesn't generally create arbitrary decree-writing powers).

The legal foundation of such searching would have to be a new law: then the question is what the law requires that could make on-the-road body searches constitutional. Since the right to be free of unreasonable searches is a fundamental constitutional right, this law would be reviewed under strict scrutiny. Searches ""just for fun"" will not pass such scrutiny, nor will ""because it's an emergency"" or ""keep the public safe"". Having the disease is not and cannot be a crime, so this law would have to be founded on a strict no-travel requirement. That brings the matter within the sphere of the ""officer safety"" exception in the case of an arrest. I'm not suggesting that an absolute travel ban would be upheld as constitutional in the US, but that is the kind of legal foundation that would be required for state police to force people to be Covid-searched.

Theoretically, you could file for eviction against your tenant and at some point the petition could be granted, and the sheriff would enforce it. Those are the current legal options. Current (optimistic) projections are that evictions could happen in the second half of May.

So it is perfectly legal for a resident U.S. citizen to operate a foreign business entity, earn profit, pay himself, and even bank the money overseas.

5299,50459,Coronavirus - Exercise in a UK National Park,"During the current Coronavirus lockdown in the UK (England), is it legal for me to:


  a) Drive for over one hour (alone) to reach the start of my walk.
  
  b) Walk for 4-5 hours (alone) keeping at least 2m away from other people.
  
  c) Drive home again.


The law seems to say that I am allowed to leave my house for exercise but does not stipluate how long this should take.  It also does not state that use of a car is not allowed.

Edit:

Yes, this question is against the ""spirit"" of the law, but that is not the question being asked, if we get into the morality of it then we have to start taking peoples rights into consideration, one of those rights is to go where they want and to do what they want, even if that means that someone else suffers in some way.  People have fought and died for our rights over hundreds of years, you cannot just ignore that.
",50460,"There is no clear answer, and I suspect an argument could be made either way. 

The relevant regulations in this case are The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. In particular, regulation 6(1) states that:


  6.—(1) During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.


In this case, you would be relying on the reasonable excuse given in regulation 6(2)(b):


  (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), a reasonable excuse includes the need—[...]
  (b) to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household;


The regulations do not explicitly state:


how far you may travel for the purposes of exercise,
how long you may exercise for
even, in contrast with government advice, how many times a day you may leave your house for exercise.


It would require the interpretation of the courts to decide whether travelling for long distances was reasonable in order to take exercise, and whether exercising for many hours is reasonable. Michael Gove stated in an interview that:


  I would have thought that for most people, a walk of up to an hour, or a run of 30 minutes or a cycle ride of between that, depending on their level of fitness is appropriate.


This is of course not law, but opinion; yet it is worth keeping in mind that the courts may take a similar view to this.

A strong argument could be made to say that this scenario is not in fact necessary exercise, but leisure, which is not considered a reasonable excuse in the regulations. Equally, it could be argued that the regulations do support travel for exercise in any form. I don't think anyone could answer with certainty whether this is legal or not, until the law is tested on this point.

Of course it was reasonable to leave for exercise but was it reasonable to travel that far and was it reasonable to do so for that amount of time? I believe you would not be able to justify the distance or the time.  Note: even less so now the government have updated the rules on excercise to include:

5303,50481,Are there laws in the USA that prevent news from reporting false information about a situation that could put lives at risk?,"There has been quite a bit of misinformation flowing about COVID-19, some of it has even been reported on major news agencies, the one most heard about being Fox and Friends claiming, falsely, that the ability to hold your breath for 19 seconds is a good indicator of COVID-19 infection; but this is hardly limited to one show or wrong fact.  Given the threat of COVID-19, and how each infection increases the risk of future infections exponentially, the misinformation being spread could realistically put lives at risk.

Now I'm not suggesting anyone be punished for COVID-19 misinformation specifically, for many reasons.  However, it got me wondering at a more general level if there are forces in place to handle more direct and blatant spread of dangerous misinformation via the news.

It does make me wonder what laws exist for intentional spread of misinformation.  Slander and Libel laws only apply to misinformation about an individual, they wouldn't apply to other forms of misinformation.  The FDA has stepped in to stop false claims about drugs and medication, but again that is only one specific type of misinformation.

What about more general misinformation?  If some news agency decides as an April fools joke to report that the government is encouraging all kids to play on highways today, or some other grossly negligent and potentially dangerous fact, and there is reasonable evidence to suggest it was done intentionally what laws may be used to penalize such a dangerous spread of misinformation?
",50494,"While the other two sort out their disagreement, here's one way the broadcast of misinformation is regulated which is not subject to dispute.

There is a federal agency called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The FCC regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories.  

Among its duties and powers, it prohibits the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster ""knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.""  FCC rules indicate that the harm ""must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties."" 

Additionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for ""broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge."" 

The FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is narrow in scope.  Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with ""direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news."" 

The FCC's authority for this may be found at 47 CFR § 73.1217, which states: 


  § 73.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. 
  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast
  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a
  catastrophe if:
  
  (a) The licensee knows this information is false;
  
  (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause
  substantial public harm, and
  
  (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause
  substantial public harm.
  
  Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to
  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the
  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable
  under the circumstances.


Important context is included in the accompanying note, which states: 


  For purposes of this rule, “public harm” must begin immediately, and
  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety
  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public
  health and safety authorities from their duties. The public harm will
  be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with a significant
  degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A “crime” is any act
  or omission that makes the offender subject to criminal punishment by
  law. A “catastrophe” is a disaster or imminent disaster involving
  violent or sudden event affecting the public.


EDIT: Addition:

More helpful context may come from Sec. 4 of this law review article and you may find the article in general, about criminalizing false speech on social media, interesting: https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/31HarvJLTech65.pdf

You have noted that there are certain limits on false or unproven claims in very specific contexts, in particular relying on laws passed by Congress under the Commerce Clause (no false advertising...).

Misinformation has put lives at risk for centuries, a fact that was well-understood by the Founders and Framers. For this reason, the First Amendment precludes the development of a governmental Truth Bureau which decides what is true and what false or misleading statements are to be punished.

I'd prefer not to say more for privacy reasons. Until recently, it's been only a minor annoyance.

But since things have been locked down due to the coronavirus outbreak, I've been spending a lot more time at home, and the traffic on the parkway has gotten lighter, meaning that at least anecdotally speeds have increased. The result is a huge increase in infrasound. It's like my whole apartment is shaking all day.

Many infected people have been isolated to prevent the spread of the virus. However, medical resources are highly deficient in serious regions, leaving many patients untreated (or badly treated). Under this circumstance, is it just to isolate them?
",49215,"Questions about whether a certain action is ""just"" tend to be maters of opinion, politics and philosophy, but it can be addressed from the perspective of legal theory (especially following the model of common law, where legal principles are based on concepts of just and proper action). Whether or not a certain action is actually legal in a certain jurisdiction depends on the laws of that country -- I suspect that the answer is different for the US versus China.

The first question would be whether those government officials have the legal authority – I assume they do. Such authority is generally governed by some specific circumstances, for example, ""poses an imminent and grave threat to public health"". It is basically not a legal question whether quarantining in the face of this viral threat is necessary from a public health perspective, that is a medical question. What the law would say is that if this is a serious threat, then a person's liberty can be curtailed to a limited extent, because a person does not have the right to harm others because they don't want to do some thing that protects the rights of others (be vaccinated, stay in quarantine until it is safe). However, principles of legal justice also say that the government's response should be proportionate, e.g. shoot-on-sight in response to a sneeze is not proportionate. 

Quarantining has long been recognized as a valid, just and legal response to such extreme medical threats. Historically speaking, quarantining used to be the only effective action that a government can take against e.g. smallpox, plague, Spanish flu, Ebola.

Turning the CD into mp3s afterward is not circumnavigating the DRM as the CDs can't have copy protection that interferes with the legal use of a CD - in fact besides a ""do not copy me"" flag a CD may not contain any copy protection or it is not a CD by its Red-Book Standard.

  How is banning such events constitutional with the freedom of
  assembly?


The rights created by the First Amendment are not absolute. They are subject to reasonable restrictions as to time, place and manner, especially if those restrictions are content neutral. 

Restrictions narrowly tailored to protect against genuine threats public health and safety fall within the exception of the First Amendment even if they are not strictly content neutral, that is commonly described by the rubric that you don't have a right to falsely cry ""fire"" in a crowded theater (causing a riot that could harm people). 

For example, suppose that a rope bridge over a deep gorge can only support the weight of ten people, and three dozen people want to hold a protest there. A regulation that prohibited more than ten people from engaging in the protest would be constitutional.

Even then, however, a lack of content neutrality (e.g., restricting punishment to false statements likely to incite a riot) can't also be a lack of ideological neutrality (e.g. restricting punishment to anti-Catholic but not anti-Jewish statements likely to incite a riot).


  If it were a political protest/gathering would this change?


Generally speaking political protest/gatherings are still subject to content neutral regulations of time, place or manner, and those narrowly tailored to protect genuine threats public health and safety.

So, for example, if there is a genuine COVID-19 risk that public health officials are trying to address, and the regulation of gatherings is not viewpoint or content based, it would be upheld as constitutional in the face of a First Amendment freedom of assembly limitation.

But, if the regulation applied, for example, only to Republican and not Democratic party protests or gatherings, which is a viewpoint or content based restriction, it would not survive a First Amendment freedom of assembly challenge. 
",Reasonable,"A government ban on all gatherings of more than 10 people in the context of minimizing damage from a pandemic is something that is quite understandable.  But people need to appreciate that there is a fine line between banning gatherings/movement/human-activity for a useful, acceptable and TEMPORARY reason and a totalitarian repression of the citizenry.  

The current decree from many states ""banning"" gatherings/movement of 10 or more people, on the face of it, effects the same thing as say Stalin's dictatorial orders prohibiting gatherings/movement of people within the former Soviet Union.  

Whilst people should isolate themselves and limit gatherings until the pandemic is over, is this something that might be better framed as a ""request"" by the governor(s)? Is it wise to set a precedent whereby a single person (governor or US President) on a moments notice, ""bans"" gatherings or movements of people?

Yes, governments have the broad authority to enact laws.  The US prohibits  and regulates pathogen experimentation (self-infection). There are also rules regarding shipping and export (ITAR).  Furthermore, in the US, there are (FL, NY state) laws that prevent patients from being tested unless the order is given by an authorized health care professional.  Hopefully, you do live in a state that does not have this regulation (AZ).

While I do believe in one's right to do as one sees fit with one's own body, there is the counter-argument: there must be limits when it comes to unnecessarily exposing the community to pathogen risk.  I hope that this question is theoretical and that nobody actually believes the immunity supposition without a credible peer-reviewed scientific publication.  Unfortunately we live in an age where misinformation is propagated at novel speed and scale.

I wish the OP well.  That being said, I have concerns regarding the underlying assumptions of the question.  While I am comfortable with the OP question, the underlying assumptions give me great pause.

UPDATE

IMHO: I hope that no reader will seriously consider amateur experimentation in self-infection in the hope of conferring immunity. Giving a pathogen uncontrolled safe-haven to propagate and possibly infect others seems irresponsible.

I doubt that the government cares if any individual manages to puts themselves in an early grave, however, it does care if amateurs create an unnecessary pandemic risk.   I would think that any government would view pathogen experimentation much like nuclear device experimentation, because of the mass casualty risk.  I hope that readers understand the implications of an amateur uncontrolled experiment.

This requires that the census seek data describing the population on April 1, 2020.  It does not require that census workers actually visit people on that day.

United Kingdom (England and Wales)

This gives a short overview of the compensation rights of people who feel that their property (in general, not just a motor vehicle) has been unfairly damaged in a search.


  Constituents sometimes ask whether they can get compensation for damage (for example to a front door) following forced entry by the police. Police forces do sometimes make ex gratia payments or pay compensation following such damage, for example where the raid was at the wrong premises. However, statutory guidance states that compensation for such damage is “unlikely to be appropriate if the search was lawful, and the force used can be shown to be reasonable, proportionate and necessary to effect entry.” Where a police force refuses to make such a payment, then a constituent wishing to pursue the matter further would need to obtain specialist legal advice.


However, if a person wishes to press the issue, s/he can always sue the police.


  The Police Powers page on the Citizen’s Advice website gives the following very general information about suing the police:
  
  
    If your complaint is serious, you may wish to sue the police. You can sue the police in the same way that you can sue members of the public. If you want to sue the police, you should talk to a specialist solicitor.
  


United States

42 U.S.C. § 1983 sets forth some parameters for suing law enforcement officials.


  Under Section 1983 damages can take the form of nominal damages, compensatory damages and punitive damages.
  
  
  Compensatory Damages may include lost earnings, loss of earning capacity, out of pocket expenses, pain/suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress suffered. There is no inherent “value” in constitutional rights. Damage awards for 1983 actions, separate and aside from normal tort standards, may not be based on the abstract “value” or “importance of constitutional rights"" There may, however, be inferred damages, which arise in situations where the circumstances themselves surrounding the violation imply actual damages.
  Punitive Damages may be assessed when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected right. Punitive damages may be found even when the underlying threshold for liability is recklessness. Municipalities are immune from punitive damages.
  Injunctive Relief may be awarded.
  Nominal Damages may be awarded by the jury if they determine that the plaintiff's Constitutional rights were violated but they do not believe that they suffered substantive damages.
  


However, the person must prove that their rights have been explicitly violated. This is often difficult to do.

Two cases of interest are Cody v. Mello and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. The latter has been widely used alongside 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to support the idea that people can be compensated for damages.

In any case, to gain damages, a person must bring a civil suit to court. It may or may not be successful, depending on the circumstances.

It would appear that there are two contracts here: the one where you paid the holding deposit in return for them holding it - this contract would appear to be complete. If you choose not to follow through with the second contract - actually leasing the premises; then that would not affect the contract that has already happened.

The concept of Force Majeure is not applicable here: both parties appear to be able to fulfill their contractual obligations even if you are quarantined - them to have the apartment available, you to pay the rent. The fact that you can't get the benefit of the contract is not a Force Majeure event. That's even assuming the contract deals with Force Majeure because, in common law jurisdictions, war, famine, pestilence, death and any other horsemen of the apocalypse you care to name do not relieve you of your contractual obligations.

8563,49931,Why don't governments and private companies sue China for economic and life losses due to COVID-19 (corona virus)?,"We are witnessing the financial and personal repercussions of the spread of the corona virus that originated in Wuhan. It seems that the virus started spreading possibly as early as mid-November with the Chinese government trying to hide/downplay/minimize the issue at hand. Given the Chinese government failure to:


Prevent the sale of raw animal meat and enforce the necessary sanitary measures to avoid human contact with raw meat.
Allowing farming and selling of wild animals, which was than corrected later by issuing a law banning such sales, thus admitting the problem.
Properly contain the spread in Wuhan by acknowledging the alarm calls of the local doctors and first signs that an unknown strain of corona virus was circulating.


Is it possible for governments and private companies, I imagine only the most powerful ones, to sue the Chinese government to seek financial compensation for the damages occurred worlwide?

I imagine that if a private company would accidentally leak a virus outside a lab, such company would be liable for all damages, why is a government not liable for any damage in this case? Can, theoretically, Chinese or citizens from other countries sue the Chinese government for the loss of loved ones?
",49933,"The main problem is that there is no court with authority to hear this case outside of China. It may be futile to sue in US courts, since China will not enforce US judgments. You can sue a Chinese company in Chinese court, under their Civil Procedure Law, but this pertains to contract breach. The question is whether there is any law under which the government of China can be sued for negligence – it is unlikely that that is possible (perhaps there is an expert in Chinese law here who can address that issue).

This lawsuit is filed in US courts. It is based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Supposing that this lawsuit is successful in US courts, then the question is what enforcement actions are possible. Since the defendants are various governments and government agencies in China, execution of the judgment would have to be against those defendants – you can't seize the assets of every person with some connection to China. But given the nature of the Chinese government, it is possible that US courts could find that the assets of Chinese companies are effectively government assets.

The short answer is, in fact a lawsuit has been filed, and I expect more. I also don't expect them to succeed in the long run.
",Reasonable,"Yes, technology patents are useful.

Regarding the Amazon patent you referred to, it only covers Amazon's one-click ordering (and similar single-action ordering), and it is immensely valuable to Amazon. Their competitors (essentially, anyone who sells things online) would love to use a similar system, but to do so, they must either pay Amazon a licensing fee or risk being sued for patent infringement.

Beyond the value that patents can bring in court or at the negotiation table, and the value that they can have in dissuading potential competitors from taking away your business, patents can also have great defensive value. Some technology companies amass vast collections of patents for defensive purposes. They do not necessarily plan to sue anyone for patent infringement, but if one of their competitors were to sue them, they have the arsenal to effectively countersue.

8685,49944,Fifth Amendment and Mandatory Shelter in Place,"Several counties in California have issued a shelter in place order due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, see a Santa Clara’s order here.

The order states that individuals have to shelter in place. However, it lists multiple exceptions. If a police officer or other authority empowered to enforce this law asks you why you are outside, do you have to tell why you are outside or does the officer have to have reasonable suspicion you are in violation of the shelter in place order in order to detain you? This seems to be in violation of the concept that exercising your rights does not give grounds for reasonable suspicion or probable cause. Does an officer need probably cause that you are in violation of the order to arrest you? Or is it assumed that if you do not tell the officer what you are doing outside then your behavior is in violation of the order?
",49945,"The principle of constitutional law is that in order to arrest you, the officer would need probable cause. Certain acts are in themselves violations of the order (being closer to another person that 6 feet, illegal sneezing). Walking in public does not per se constitute a violation. In order to briefly stop a person walking on the street (a ""Terry stop""), the officer needs a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of the law. That means there has to be a reason, and a gut feeling does not count. An officer would not (legally) be able to stop every person they see walking down the street / driving, and demand an explanation of where they are going. If a person is just aimlessly wandering down the strees with friends (even if they are sufficiently separated), that could suffice to justify a stop, given the limited legal excuses for being outside your home.

  Restaurants, pubs and clubs must close


Although our wedding venue has a bar, serves food and has a dance floor in the marquee, they have not closed and therefore our insurance is not paying out as the wedding can technically still go ahead.

Is the Prime minister’s closure statement enough to claim on our wedding insurance?
",50080,"What do the contracts with your suppliers and the policy with your insurer say?

Changes in government regulation do not ipso facto relieve Parties of the obligations under a contract under common (English) law. Contracts are allowed to allocate the risk of force majeure (and indeed, to define it because it has no common law meaning) but if they don’t, then each party bears their own risk and if they fail to honour their obligations they are in breach of contract. 

Common law does have the doctrine of frustration, however, that is much narrower and must result in the inability of the contract to be completed at all.

And then there are consumer rights which may apply.

When the dust settles, we are likely to see a lot of litigation around force majeure.

Your venue appears to be complying with both the law and their obligations under the contract so you have no breach of contract claim against them and no trigger for the insurance policy. If you choose to cancel, then you broke the contract.

Importantly, the position is reversed in civil law jurisdictions - a party unable to fulfil their obligations under a contract is not in breach.

9285,50118,What effect does an event like the current Covid-19 pandemic have on contractural obligations?,"Across the world, the current pandemic, and various government responses to it will impact on parties abilities to perform their obligations under a contract. 

What are the legal implications of this?
",50119,"Force Majeure

An event like the current Covid-19 event is what is known as a force majeure event; a Latin term meaning ""superior force"". It refers to an event that is beyond the control of the parties to a contract such as war, civil disturbance, acts of God and disease.

Common law jurisdictions

In common law jurisdictions (most of the English-speaking world), force majeure is not a legal doctrine but a creature of the particular contract. That is, the extent to which a contract does or doesn't deal with such events is the extent to which such events apply to that particular contract. For example, a construction contract may specify that a contractor is responsible for the care, protection and reinstatement of the works unless damage is caused by war. So, if the damage is caused by war the principal bears the risk but if it's caused by, say, flood, the contractor bears the risk.

If a contract is silent on the matter (in general or in the specific) then the parties obligations remain unchanged by the event and failure to comply is a breach of contract. For example, absent a provision in a contract, in the current pandemic:


if a supplier is contracted to supply a component that was made in a foreign country and that cannot now be sourced from there; they will be in breach of their contract if they do not supply it. If it can be sourced from a local manufacturer at twice the price of the foreign source then that is the contractor's loss.
if a company is contracted to provide engineering services and their staff cannot travel (either because they are sick or because of government restrictions) then they will be in breach of their contract and the principal can seek damages.
if a construction contractor is obliged to finish by a given date and the government closes all construction sites, they will be in breach if they do not complete by that date notwithstanding.


These may seem to be unjust outcomes but, at the end of the day, somebody in the contract has to carry the cost of force majeure events and the development of the common law has left it for the parties to decide who. That is, at the time of negotiating the contract, the law allows that if the parties wanted to consider the risks of say, a pandemic, and spell out whose risk that was, they were free to do so and if they didn't that's their own fault - in the absence of such allocation, the parties must do what the contract says they must do. Common law jurisdictions have traditionally not seen it as the role of government to interfere in the details of private contracts.

Common law has a much narrower doctrine of frustration but this requires that the principal purpose of the contract be impossible to perform, not merely harder or more expensive to perform. Even much harder or much more expensive.

Civil law

In civil law jurisdictions (continental Europe with their ex-colonies and most of Asia), force majeure is a legal doctrine. 

It is a defence to liability where the defendant:


had nothing to do with the event - this pandemic would fit,
is unpredictable - it is not certain that the pandemic was unpredictable. There have been pandemics before and many organisations around the world exist specifically to respond to them. Lest this seems needlessly pedantic, there have been cases decided that because a flood occurred 69 years ago, this flood was predictable; similarly, an avalanche 50 years ago rendered this one predictable. If predictable, then the defendant is obliged to have prepared for it.
The consequences must have been unpreventable.


So, even though it exists in civil law it is not a get out of jail free card.

International law

The UNIDROIT Principles encompass force majeure as follows:


  Non-performance by a party is excused if that party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome it or its consequences.

9417,50184,Schengen Area: What was the legal rationale for countries extending Temporary Reintroduction of Border Control beyond Nov. 2017?,"(This is not about the coronavirus pandemic, which I understand is a different issue, but about the six countries that had already been maintaining border controls since related to migration and terrorism since 2016.)

Could someone explain to me the legal basis of Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway's extension of ""temporary reintroduction of border control"" declarations past the original 2-year deadline in November 2017? I'm trying to understand what the legal justification was for that, and I just keep getting more and more confused the more I read. Was the Commission's recommendation of September 2017 on extending the time frames adopted at some point? Or did they find some other loophole? 

I have found some media references to them ""switching to France's strategy"" (which I don't understand well either) or switching from Article 29 provisions to Article 25 provisions. But when I read the Schengen Borders Code, I can't find anything in Article 25 that I can manage to interpret as allowing unlimited extensions.

I understand that there's an argument that what these five countries and France have been doing is indeed illegal, but I want to also understand what their own lawyers' argument would be for its legality.

Thanks in advance!
",50545,"Regarding Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, details can be found on the Commission website. According to the table of all notifications, they all periodically invoke the “security  situation  in  Europe  and  threats  resulting from the continuous significant secondary movements”. This is obviously in blatant contradiction with article 25 but in practice that doesn't matter. You cannot find anything in there foreseeing unlimited extensions because there isn't. It's as simple as that, no sophisticated legal wizardry is involved (regarding the fate of Juncker's 2017 proposal: that limit hasn't changed since the current framework was introduced in 2013 and is still present in the June 2019 consolidated version of the Borders Code).

By contrast, France's strategy is to ignore the law entirely (as opposed to merely ignoring some specific clause of article 25): introduce quasi-systematic checks on some borders, don't try to create half-hearted legal justifications, don't notify the Commission or invoke some generic “persistent terrorist threat” applying to all borders and count on the Commission to carefully avoid challenging France on this. Back in 2015, the country suffered a string of deadly terrorist attacks and ultimately activated a state of emergency so that it had already invoked the right to reintroduce border controls and did not need any additional notification when the refugee crisis worsened.

The table on the Commission's website gives some additional insight into how all this came to pass. Back in 2015, many countries invoked article 28 with rather specific justifications related to the increasing number of refugees entering the Schengen area. After this initial unilateral move, the Council issued three recommendations to give these countries some legal cover (November 2016, February 2017, and May 2017) while roughly following the letter of article 25 (no more than six-month extension at once, not more than two years of border controls in total). Meanwhile, the Commission initiated a “Back to Schengen” strategy to try to salvage open borders in the Schengen area and make sure they appeared to be in charge.

But in reality, the countries in question were clearly intent on imposing checks no matter what, even if it was not possible to find some other face-saving legal basis. So when the last six-month period expired, they stopped being so specific and just reverted to a generic notification while everybody else turned a blind eye.

Note that the Commission does have a tool to enforce these rules and force a member state to, at the very least, make an effort to offer a more detailed legal rationale for its actions: infringement proceedings. For a long time, rules pertaining to the “Area of freedom, security and justice” were subject to different rules but since 2014, it falls under the ordinary EU law regime. The Commission has however been very shy in launching infringement proceedings on such a politically sensitive topic.

9597,50295,Are Employers Obliged to let you Return to Work Early from Unpaid Leave?,"I have been an employee at the company for over 5-year and I had requested time off work (4-months) to do sabbatical with some travelling. It was granted by my line manager. The request was made in person and then finalised in email.

However, fast-forward to now and due to the coronavirus pandemic, I have had to return home early from my travels, at great financial cost. As such, I am keen to start working again as soon as possible and can do so from home with ease. FYI, before leaving I was working from home once a week anyway!

I having had a call with my line manager, he says it won't be possible to return before the original return date, almost 2-months away. I am certain that in any normal situation (e.g. sans corona) they would be pleased to have me back early. After all, there was a reluctance to let me go in the first place. When I pressed him on why, I was told my pay wasn't in the budget for April and due to corona they were already down in their P&amp;L.

However, the UK government is willing to reimburse companies pay 80% of people's wages if the coronavirus has stopped them from working, so this seems a weak reason.

Either way, this leaves me in a very strange situation: I am employee but I am not being payed.

Therefore my questions are as such:


Can my company legally stop me from returning to work, if it is not from something such as illness, etc? Alternatively, there is a mechanism in place that can allow me to return to work earlier?
If I am not allowed to return to work, what does this mean for my employment status? If I was unemployed I could claim certain benefits, however, I would consider myself employed so I feel rather in limbo right now!


Any advice on this would be REALLY appreciated.

TL;DR


I requested 4-months leave
I have asked to start again 2-months
early
I am being denied that
Do I have a right to start again early?/Are they obligated to allow me to return early?




Outcome

It seems that I am in a rather strange, but probably not entirely unique position, so I will detail some findings for those that might find them useful.

My employment status remains ""Employed"", as suggested in the answers. However, I wrongly assumed this excludes me from claiming Universal Credits.

As you say in your TL;DR you arranged 4 months leave and your employer no doubt made arrangements to deal with your absence. Now, you want to return early; they are not obliged to allow you to do so just as you would not be obliged to do so if they wanted you to cut your leave short.

No doubt the current pandemic has changed the situation and in its absence, they might have been more willing to have you back early. But then, you wouldn't want to be coming back early.

Your employment status is that you are employed and on leave.

",50533,"Redundancy is a form of dismissal from employment — in other words, a permanent end to your employment. This is usually done if an employer needs to downsize, or if the job that you are employed for no longer exists. For example, if A runs a factory and decides to close it, the employees of that factory would likely be redundant. You are generally entitled to redundancy pay in this case.

In the UK, a lay off is asking an employee to stay at home or take unpaid leave when the employer does not have any work to give the employee. This is a temporary situation: your employment does not end, but you may not be paid as there is no work for you to do. A person who is laid off may be entitled to statutory guarantee pay.

A furlough is essentially the same thing as a lay off, although the term has become significantly more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government guidance states that


  If you and your employer both agree, your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is known as being ‘on furlough’.

There is this thing called the ""Rogers test"", from Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 which essentially says that in an expressive work, you can't use a trademark in a way that has ""no artistic relevance to the underlying work"" or if it ""explicitly misleads as to the source or the content"": that's a lesser restriction than the ""confusion"" test, which is the standard commercial speech test.

",50569,"Your interpretation seems to be correct. A furloughed employee is defined by Acas to be one who is ""temporarily sent home because there's no work"". This could in principle be through unpaid leave. 

The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is a government scheme to compensate employers for the wage bills of their staff during the furlough, so that the furloughed staff can continue to receive some income. An employee would have no direct dealings with the scheme and would continue to be paid via their employer. 

Your company seems to be offering to match the terms offered to employees under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme of 80% of salary, presumably out of their own funds. A kind gesture, it seems!
",Reasonable,"At a minimum, what the theater did was not a crime. When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a ""license"" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.

As a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.

Whether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.

Indeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.

There is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.

Another fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non-discriminatory manner.

I don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined. I would give you at least a 20% chance of prevailing if you took the issue to court although I would agree that it is more likely than not that you would not prevail if you took the issue to court.

The issue is that my construction work has stopped due to the UK lockdown and I would like my license to be paused. I don't have a force majeure clause in the contract and I don't want to keep paying the neighbours whilst no work is going on. What should I do?
",50627,"Negotiate with your neighbour

Force Majeure in English law only exists if it is detailed in the contract. There is no general legal concept like there is in civil law jurisdictions. Further, even if there was such a clause, it would need to capture Covid-19 within the definition of Force Majeure either by defining it sufficiently broadly or by naming “pandemics” a one type of Force Majeure event.

English law has the much narrower doctrine of frustration but that requires that the supervening event becomes impossible, not just more onerous or expensive. It doesn’t apply here.

It’s also possible for a contract to have a change of law clause - this would probably apply to Covid-19 since the proximate reason for your work stopping is likely a government regulation. However, these are generally worded to allow the payee to recover additional costs of complying with the law, not to reduce the payer’s obligations. Notwithstanding, I’m guessing that your contract doesn’t have one of these either.

In your case you are required to keep paying and the have the scaffold removed before the deadline or you will be in breach and liable for damages. Under the terms of your contract, you took the risk of pandemics even if you didn’t know you were.
",Reasonable,"I don't see any reason why you would. Nothing required you to have garbage service, you never ordered garbage service, and your contract explicitly says that you are the one who arranges such services.

I would suggest responding in writing to your landlord informing them that you did not contract for garbage service and that it is not required. Quote that section of your agreement. Ask if it's their position that garbage service is required and, if so, how they reach that conclusion.

It can help prioritize areas of immediate concern.
",Reasonable,"The idea is that you can check whether the answer is at most some value $m$ in time $O(n)$. Applying binary search on $m$, you obtain an $O(n\log n)$ solution.

How do you check whether the answer is at most $m$ in time $O(n)$? The idea is to slide a window of length $m$ across your array. If at some point all elements outside the window are distinct, then we are done.

How do we implement this sliding algorithm? Let $A$ be the original array. We initialize an array $M$ which contains the histogram of the elements in $A_{m+1},\ldots,A_n$, as well as the number of distinct elements $x$. If $x = n-m$ then we are done. Otherwise, we modify $M$ to contain the histogram of $A_1,A_{m+2},\ldots,A_n$:


We remove one copy of the element $A_{m+1}$ from $M$. If the new count of this element is $0$, then we decrease $x$.
We add one copy of the element $A_1$ to $M$. If the new count of this element is $1$, then we increase $x$.


In this way, we can update $M$ in time $O(1)$ per shift.

The solution you link to does all this, apart from maintaining $x$; this is done automatically by the C++ map data structure.

Another point is the time complexity of this solution, which might depend on your exact computation model.

It is not a personal health question.  The question has broad utility, in cases where others find themselves in social-distancing or quarantine with need for surface sanitizer, and their only available ingredients are water and powdered oxy-bleach.

I need a quantity of surface sanitizer to decontaminate boxes delivered to the house during the Coronavirus19 social-distancing period.  

CDC and WHO say 0.5% hydrogen peroxide solution will destroy coronavirus19.  And powdered oxy-bleach a.k.a. Sodium percarbonate contains 32.5% by weight of hydrogen peroxide, I'll call it roughly a third.

So to make a water solution of hydrogen peroxide using powdered oxy-bleach, I'm thinking I need to add enough powdered oxy-bleach (by weight) to equal 3 x 0.5% of the weight of the water. I.e, for a gallon of solution, 1.5% of 8.3 pounds, thus 0.12 lb, or ~2 oz.

A friend checked this and agreed, saying:
""A 0.5% H2O2 solution in water will consist of (per gallon): 0.42 lbs of H2O2 and 7.9 lbs of H2O. To get 0.42 lbs of H2O2 out of Oxy-bleach (32.5% H2O2), divide 0.42 by 0.325, which = 0.128 lbs or 2.0529230769 ounces...😁""

",129168,"Yes, do use household dilute H2O2 but, in general, do not use commercial percarbonates powders as they can contain an additive to convert the friendly percarbonate into more powerful Peracetic acid (PAA). The latter allows the otherwise weak bleaching power of the H2O2 to compete with chlorine-based bleaching. However, this comes at a price (safety). Hence, the dire warning labels, usually in at least two languages, on Oxi-Bleach and generic related products.

I quote myself on this subject:


  Sodium percarbonate is chemically just an addition compound of Na2CO3 and Hydrogen peroxide.
  
  Also, while Sodium carbonate and Sodium percarbonate (basically Na2CO3 and 3Na2CO3.2H2O2) are often listed as the main ingredients in typical chlorine free bleach, an additive, TAED, which acts as a key activator (see, for example) is not even listed on the label. TetraAcetylEthyleneDiamine is apparently commonly employed as a bleach activator in many laundry products (see this).  TAED reacts with H2O2 in alkaline conditions (referred to as perhydrolysis) creating, in part, Peracetic Acid. The latter PAA is actually preferred over sluggish H2O2 for bleaching. In other words, it is not the H2O2 as the active bleaching agent, but PAA created in situ.  So, other than possibly misleading implying that eco friendly hydrogen peroxide is the active agent, it is, in reality, PAA, a probematic compound with associated  health concerns (see Marquand, E. C.; et al. , 2007. ""Asthma Caused by Peracetic Acid-Hydrogen Peroxide Mixture"". J. Occup. Health. 49 (2): 155–158.). Here is a MSDS on an actual PAA mix ( 76-61% water, PAA 20-35%, 3% Acetic acid and 1% H2O2) available at which is far from friendly but does eventually totally decompose into harmless O2, CO2, H2O,...
  
  As such anyone using a commercial percarbonate product should at least be aware of safety issues and that one is likely employing a Peracetic acid mix.


However, such more powerful PAA based mixtures do have their use and is recommended by the U.S. Military as a chemical/biological warfare decontamination protocol (see ""Development of Bicarbonate-Activated Peroxide as a Chemical and Biological Warfare Agent Decontaminant""). So, it is up to the user to weigh the relative risks of the situation.

Mercury in its (+2) salts does not have lone pairs readily accessible for covalent bonding. However, its 5d electrons do affect its properties,  resulting in a relatively high polarisability.

The long story:

Mercury is the last 5d element and has electron configuration $[\ce{Xe}] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^2$. The $6s$ electrons are the outermost electrons and readily available for covalent bonding. $4f$ electrons are virtually inert since they are very deep. $5d$ electrons belong to the previous shell, but are the outermost of them and once mercury looses its $4s$ electrons, $5d$ electrons become the outermost and define its properties. They are still too strongly bound to the nucleus to participate in covalent bonds under ordinary conditions ($\ce{HgF4}$ was only observed spectroscopically in inert gas matrix). , but are far enough to wiggle around and participate in non-covalent interactions, such as van-der-waals interactions. $6p$ orbitals are also available for covalent bonding, though extent of their use is often debatable and/or unobvious.

  In recent decades, drastic progress in solar fuel production has occurred: photovoltaic cells can generate electricity from the sunlight,[1−4] whereas photoelectrochemical [5] and photocatalytic [6−11] water splitting can directly produce hydrogen and oxygen by harvesting the sunlight. An electrolyzer can electrochemically split water molecules,[12,13] which can be conjugated with the photovoltaic cells.[14,15] Importantly, during the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic water splitting, what takes place on the surface is electrocatalysis, in association with the photonic processes at the bulk of photon absorber and the interface between the photon absorber and electrocatalyst.[11] Electrocatalysis will thus certainly play a crucial role in the solar fuel production process in the future. 


And further concentration-related statement taken from the abstract, where HER refers to the hydrogen evolution reaction:


  The choice of electrolyte in terms of its identity and activity drastically altered the HER performance. Electrolyte properties (activity coefficient, kinematic viscosity and diffusion coefficient) accurately described the mass-transport contribution, which was easily isolated when a highly active Pt catalyst was used. The HER rate on the Pt was maximized by tuning the solute concentration (typically 1.5 – 2.0 M). Moreover, the kinematic viscosity and oxygen solubility under such densely buffered conditions governed the oxygen mass-transport flux in the electrolyte, which in turn tuned the cross-over flux. At near-neutral pH, as high as 90% selectivity toward the HER was achieved even under an oxygen saturated condition, where only a 40 mV overpotential was needed to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for the HER. This information can be regarded as an important milestone for achieving a highly efficient water splitting system at near-neutral pH.

So this link (please read a bit of it):
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w
Says that the UV light of wavelength 222 nanometers (the photons bounces off the skin and the eyes) is absolutely harmless and do not make neither skin cancer or cataract. So this light is deadly for viruses and is not commercially available to anyone like ordinary humans (perhaps only some labs got it but sure cannot by on amazon or ebay or so). So if you wish to protect people you ideally need something to kill the virus in mid-air exactly as this lamp does.
Cite: ""By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently inactivates bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin."" - this line is at the beginning of the link above.
So my idea is to help ordinary people that have some DIY experience to make a lamp and disinfect the clothes and themself like skin and face and face mask and so.
So a guy good in chemistry of similar that ca help with his knowledge and experience to help the people and get rid of the virus.
The research I did in the internet says that the UV has ability to kill virus in 10 seconds.
So having a lamp emitting harmless 222nm UV light instead the cancer deadly 254nm UV germicidal lamps will be able to protect from the diseases.
The question is how to make it.

so I suppose you can type a good way to do it and save the half of the western world population (the old people like your grandma and grandpa)?

(Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp. Neither skills beyond the ordinary DIY - well it might be a need of experienced DIY-er.)
",129061,"UVC is very harmful to people and requires specialist equipment to create and use safely

You are not going to be able to create or use lamps that emit 222nM light without specialist equipment, and even if you could it would almost certainly not be safe.

Far UV lamps are widely commercially available for germicidal applications and these usually use mercury vapour fluorescent discharge tubes with no phosphors so have a strong emission around 250nM from a line in the mercury emission spectrum. They are very dangerous to people and have caused significant harm when used accidentally (see this video from BigClive describing what happens when they are used accidentally instead of the much less harmful ""black light"" tubes commonly used for discos and events). 

Another important fact to bear in mind is that UVC lamps of this type have to use specialist glass in manufacture because common types of glass strongly absorb UVC wavelengths. So, while they are readily available, they are not easy for an amateur to make.

You report a claim from a Nature paper than a tightly controlled UVC light of around 222nM wavelength is not harmful to people. I would be far more cautious as the Nature paper did not do extensive safety studies on the actual effect on people and given what we know about wavelengths not much longer, the claim would need some extensive validation.

But you have bigger problems than this in your pursuit of an easy-to-make solution accessible to amateurs. First, you cannot easily get around the problem of the glass used absorbing the wavelengths you want to see: you will need specialist material. Second, the actual excimer lamps as used in the nature paper are sophisticated devices that cannot easily be made by non-specialists (they are far more complex than the relatively conventional discharge tubes used in commercial UV lamps which are essentially the same as conventional visible fluorescent lamps apart from the need for specialist glass). Apart from anything else the lamps have a strong emission at around 258nM, exactly the wavelength known to be very dangerous to people from simple UVC mercury vapour lamps. The NAture paper reported using specialist narrow band filters to eliminate those wavelengths. These are unlikely to be easy to obtain. Third, creating the excimer lamps is a sophisticated process requiring specialist pulsed electronic drivers to get the lamp to work (most likely, according to this reference in the Nature paper, you need to fine tune the gas mixture and the pressure and the driving electronics for the lamp which is far more complex than a simple driver for a fluorescent tube).

And, as for ""Nobody needs glass (or quartz) blowing of a lamp"", I'm afraid you are delusional. You need specialist glass to let the right wavelengths through and specialist filters to kill the harmful wavelengths. This is not ""simple DIY"".

You have seen an interesting paper in Nature and assumed it is easy for someone to make in their shed. This is not true. Specialist skills are required and attempting anything without those skills is likely highly dangerous (and that is ignoring the issues of handling the chemicals and vacuum technology needed to create the lamp: both are dangerous). 

And, perhaps more importantly, the best way to avoid contamination of others with covid-19 is to wash your hands. There are no easy technological silver bullets here, though, perhaps, professional engineers and chemists can build something safe based on the Nature observation in the future.
",Reasonable,"Interesting and per your cited source, to quote:


  [...] far-UVC light generated by filtered excimer lamps emitting in the 207 to 222 nm wavelength range, efficiently inactivates drug-resistant bacteria, without apparent harm to exposed mammalian skin 13,14,15. 


Also, more details:


  Far-UVC lamps
  We used a bank of three excimer lamps containing a Kr-Cl gas mixture that predominantly emits at 222 nm 25,26. The exit window of each lamp was covered with a custom bandpass filter designed to remove all but the dominant emission wavelength as previously described 15. Each bandpass filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) had a center wavelength of 222 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25 nm and enables >20% transmission at 222 nm. 


This is a technical area and to be honest, this may not be the best forum on how to make a lamp with a Kr-Cl gas mixture with a custom bandpass filter.

I do get the feeling that they may be an associated patent application somewhere, that may provide more details. And, yes there is at least a patent pending upon performing a patent search.  To quote from the company's website:


  The New Columbia University Study again confirming the effectiveness and safety parameters of our patented wavelength (222nm) referred to by Columbia as Far-UVC.
  
  These results confirm studies that we have been doing for the last 12 years. We have patented 222nm for air, liquid and surface disinfection.
  
  Our patents cover all forms of skin and eye disinfection. We are in the process of getting FDA approval for a number of applications.
  
  We call this wavelength Far-UV Sterilray.

21020,129319,Is it possible to measure light absorbance for analysis of lead concentration without photospectrophotmeter,"I’m designing an experiment which requires I measure final and initial lead concentrations for the determination of aqueous lead uptake by different mediums. Because lead concentrations would be measured on the ppm scale, I’d need to use a spectrophotometer to measure light absorbance by the water samplings. I could then use Beer Lambert’s Law to determine concentration. 

With recent protocols surrounding COVID-19, it’s been difficult to contact an institution. I was wondering if there was any way I could measure light absorbance of my samples at home. Is there some other apparatus I could look into using (or perhaps even purchase)? 

All the best!
",129326,"Another possibility is the grease spot photometer (aka Bunsen photometer) German Wiki page. This can be homemade, you need a piece of paper, some wax or oil, two light sources, a meter stick and for the measurement of solutions also some e.g. cardboard to shield unwanted light. Also the darker the room, the better.

The underlying idea is that light intensity from two different sources can be compared (and found to be equal) with a paper with a grease (waxed) spot: the spot will vanish when as much light is transmitted through the spot as reflected around. 

If you move a light source to achieve this condition, you can conclude relative intensities from the distance (intensity goes 1 / d² with d the distance from the respective light source). 

Here's a youtube video demonstrating this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgZdl4qRa48



How to measure photometrically

so schematically we have:

o--U----|----o

+---d---+


with light sources o, cuvette U and the spotted paper |. Measure distance $d$ between equal intensity paper position and the light source with the cuvette. 

We have $I_{transmitted} \sim \frac{1}{d^2}$

Next, a calibration series is acquired as usual: blank (which serves as $I_0$) and concentrations over the calibration range. Almost as usual:

$$E = -\lg \frac{I}{I_0} \sim \varepsilon l c$$
$$-\lg \frac{d_0^2}{d^2} = b c$$ 
$$\lg d = a + b' c$$ 

$a$ and $b$ are determined by calibration - I use here $a$ instead of $2 \lg d_0$ because several choices are possible and in general the fitted value should be used rather than the theoretical one since it includes some effects in which practice differs from theory (e.g. differences between % transmission in the grease spot from % reflection outside).

Standard addition instead of calibration would be possible as well.
",Reasonable,"Perhaps you can add H2S to create PbS (as a starting step). Then, based on an extract from Wikipedia on Lead Sulfide:


  Although of little commercial value, PbS is one of the oldest and most common detection element materials in various infrared detectors.[12] As an infrared detector, PbS functions as a photon detector, responding directly to the photons of radiation, as opposed to thermal detectors, which respond to a change in detector element temperature caused by the radiation. A PbS element can be used to measure radiation in either of two ways: by measuring the tiny photocurrent the photons cause when they hit the PbS material, or by measuring the change in the material's electrical resistance that the photons cause. Measuring the resistance change is the more commonly used method. At room temperature, PbS is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between approximately 1 and 2.5 μm. This range corresponds to the shorter wavelengths in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, the so-called short-wavelength infrared (SWIR). Only very hot objects emit radiation in these wavelengths.


some ideas. Perhaps examining a comparative study (based on known concentrations of Pb) of the changed in measured electrical resistance of a sample of PbS suspension taken from the solution after treating with the same volume of H2S followed by irradiation may provide a path. This not meant to be a complete answer, but a suggestion on a possible path to be explored.

[EDIT] To be clear, I am assuming that one cannot measure light absorbance, due to lack of equipment, for the purpose of establishing Pb concentration. But, one can perhaps measure electrical resistance. The question is can one construct a path (actually, more likely a graph to which a curve is fitted) to determine Pb concentration from the change in electrical resistance recorded upon applying a fixed amount of infrared radiation to a solution where varying amounts of PbS is introduced. If experimenting with known starting Pb concentrations, converted to PbS, suggests a detectable and measurably path with some degree of goodness-of-fit, then yes, else no (which is the only answer provided so far).

Here is some background on PbS based photodetectors where irradiation exposure varies and the amount of PbS concentration remains fixed.


  PbS is a standard SWIR semiconductor detector (1 - 3.3 µm) whereas PbSe is used in the MWIR range (1 - 4.7 µm when uncooled; up to 5.2 µm when cooled). Our lead salt detectors are photoconductive; the detector resistance is reduced during illumination. The crystal structure is polycrystalline and is produced via chemical deposition.


Please note the actual size of the PbS based photodetector. 

Note, my proposed study of feasibility avoids the use of a nephelometer (which can measure the concentration of some inert suspended particulates in say a liquid colloid by employing a light 'source' beam and a second light detector at 90° to the source beam) by taking advantage of the properties of irradiated PbS particulates. Also, it should be noted that a spectrophotometer, based on a quantitative measurement of the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength, based again on light, is also presumably not an available option.

[EDIT EDIT] Just found a reference, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE AND DISPERSED PHASE CONCENTRATION IN OIL IN WATER EMULSIONS to quote:


  The electrical resistance of a series of oil‐in‐water emulsions has been measured, and used to test the validity of four equations relating resistance with the concentration of dispersed phase. A modification of one of the equations was found to give the best relationship.


In the current context, we have a suspension of irradiated PbS in water (releasing electrons, per this 2013 article 'Photoinduced electron transfer from PbS quantum dots to cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes: light activation of a protein inhibitor'), which I would have guessed is more promising in determining the PbS concentration than say of oil in a water emulsion. 

Also found a new method to quote a source:


  In summary, we have demonstrated a practical way to measure nanoparticle concentration in a colloidal solution using quartz crystal microgravimetry. Application of a small drop of the nanoparticle colloid in a volatile organic solvent to the crystal surface leaves a dry nanoparticle film after solvent evaporation. Crystal resonant frequency shifts obeyed Sauerbrey’s equation for the dry nanoparticle concentrations up to 1300 µg/mL, as calibrated using a set of serial dilutions of Si and Ag nanopowders in methanol, rhodamine B in methanol, and ferrocene in cyclohexane.

21479,130821,Why doesn't water wash off the coronavirus alone?,"So the coronavirus has a lipid bilayer where the hydrophilic heads are facing outward. So why can't water just stick to these ends and flush out the virus particles from our hands? Is it because our hands stick better to the virus? If so, why and how does the virus stick better to our hands than water?
",130823,"Because your hands are covered in a thick crust of dirt, dust and fats, in which the virus can hide. 

But anyway still nobody has been able to show that this virus is regularily (or even rarely) transmitted via smear infection. (If someone knows about any evidence to the contrary, please come forward. And yes, some other diseases, especially bacterial infections, do even mainly take this route. That´s how you usually get the ""shits"".)

It can be detected on surfaces after hours via PCR, however PCR is as sensitive to broken down pieces of a virus particle as it is to the fresh, contagious specimen. Obviously the RNA pieces also of a destroyed virus would not evaporate, so the result of these investigations proves nothing but the extremely obvious. Newspapers are spreading it as a piece of clickbait and tinder, causing people to buy lots of ""sanitizers"".

Anyway, use soap, leave the disinfectants to the health care people who absolutely, direly need them, and be done.
",Reasonable,"Your intial step is correct, finding the number of moles of argon in the 1.1 vessel. The next step however is incorrect. Because the pressure and temperature are both in different conditions for argon in the end and argon and carbon dioxide together in the beginning, you cnnot simply subtract the volume 1.72 - 1.1 L and then find the number of moles of carbon dioxide there. Remember, subtracting the volume and finding the moles of co2 would only work if the conditions are the same, but in this case, the pressures and temepratures are different. Thus, you can just simply go about finding the total n moles of Argon and carbon dioxide through PV=nrt.

So, 1.72 (1.72L) / 0.08206 x (273 + 17) = 0.1243 total moles. Subtract 0.06869 moles from earlier from 0.1243. You will get 0.055356 moles of CO2. Now, you can use your partial pressure method.

Addendum

",446783,"There are several points that you can improve in the code 

Wrong boundary conditions

Your model is fixed to I=1 for time zero. You can either changes this point to the observed value or add a parameter in the model that shifts the time accordingly.

init &lt;- c(S = N-1, I = 1, R = 0)

# should be

init &lt;- c(S = N-Infected[1], I = Infected[1], R = 0)


Unequal parameter scales

As other people have noted the equation  

$$I' = \beta \cdot S \cdot I - \gamma \cdot I$$

has a very large value for $S \cdot I$ this makes that the value of the parameter $\beta$ very small and the algorithm which checks whether the step sizes in the iterations reach some point will not vary the steps in $\beta$ and $\gamma$ equally (the changes in $\beta$ will have a much larger effect than changes in $\gamma$). 

You can change scale in the call to the optim function to correct for these differences in size (and checking the hessian allows you to see whether it works a bit). This is done by using a control parameter. In addition you might want to solve the function in segregated steps making the optimization of the two parameters independent from each others (see more here: How to deal with unstable estimates during curve fitting? this is also done in the code below, and the result is much better convergence; although still you reach the limits of your lower and upper bounds)

Opt &lt;- optim(c(2*coefficients(mod)[2]/N, coefficients(mod)[2]), RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
         hessian = TRUE, control = list(parscale = c(1/N,1),factr = 1))


more intuitive might be to scale the parameter in the function (note the term beta/N in place of beta)

SIR &lt;- function(time, state, parameters) {
  par &lt;- as.list(c(state, parameters))
  with(par, { dS &lt;- -beta/N * S * I
  dI &lt;- beta/N * S * I - gamma * I
  dR &lt;- gamma * I
  list(c(dS, dI, dR))
  })
}


Starting condition

Because the value of $S$ is in the beginning more or less constant (namely $S \approx N$) the expression for the infected in the beginning can be solved as a single equation:

$$I' \approx (\beta \cdot N - \gamma) \cdot I $$

So you can find a starting condition using an initial exponential fit:

# get a good starting condition
mod &lt;- nls(Infected ~ a*exp(b*day), 
           start = list(a = Infected[1],
                        b = log(Infected[2]/Infected[1])))


Unstable, correlation between $\beta$ and $\gamma$

There is a bit of ambiguity how to choose $\beta$ and $\gamma$ for the starting condition. 

This will also make the outcome of your analysis not so stable. The error in the individual parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will be very large because many pairs of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ will give a more or less similarly low RSS. 

The plot below is for the solution $\beta = 0.8310849; \gamma = 0.4137507 $



However the adjusted Opt_par value $\beta = 0.8310849-0.2; \gamma = 0.4137507-0.2$ works just as well:





Using a different parameterization

The optim function allows you to read out the hessian

&gt; Opt &lt;- optim(optimsstart, RSS.SIR, method = ""L-BFGS-B"", lower = lower, upper = upper,
+              hessian = TRUE)
&gt; Opt$hessian
            b            
b  7371274104 -7371294772
  -7371294772  7371315619


The hessian can be related to the variance of the parameters (In R, given an output from optim with a hessian matrix, how to calculate parameter confidence intervals using the hessian matrix?). But note that for this purpose you need the Hessian of the log likelihood which is not the same as the the RSS (it differs by a factor, see the code below).

Based on this you can see that the estimate of the sample variance of the parameters is very large (which means that your results/estimates are not very accurate). But also note that the error is a lot correlated. This means that you can change the parameters such that the outcome is not very correlated. Some example parameterization would be:

$$\begin{array}{}
 c &amp;=&amp; \beta - \gamma \\
 R_0 &amp;=&amp; \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
\end{array}$$

such that the old equations (note a scaling by 1/N is used):

$$\begin{array}{rccl}
S^\prime &amp;=&amp; - \beta \frac{S}{N}&amp; I\\
I^\prime &amp;=&amp; (\beta \frac{S}{N}-\gamma)&amp; I\\
R^\prime &amp;=&amp; \gamma &amp;I
\end{array}
$$

become

$$\begin{array}{rccl}
S^\prime &amp;=&amp; -c\frac{R_0}{R_0-1}  \frac{S}{N}&amp; I&amp;\\
I^\prime &amp;=&amp; c\frac{(S/N) R_0 - 1}{R_0-1} &amp;I&amp; \underbrace{\approx c I}_{\text{for $t=0$ when $S/N \approx 1$}}\\
R^\prime &amp;=&amp; c \frac{1}{R_0-1}&amp; I&amp;
\end{array}
$$

which is especially appealing since you get this approximate $I^\prime = cI$ for the beginning. This will make you see that you are basically estimating the first part which is approximately exponential growth. You will be able to very accurately determine the growth parameter, $c = \beta - \gamma$. However, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, or $R_0$, can not be easily determined.

In the code below a simulation is made with the same value $c=\beta - \gamma$ but with different values for $R_0 = \beta / \gamma$. You can see that the data is not capable to allow us differentiate which different scenario's (which different $R_0$) we are dealing with (and we would need more information, e.g. the locations of each infected individual and trying to see how the infection spread out).

It is interesting that several articles already pretend to have reasonable estimates of $R_0$. For instance this preprint Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549)

How is R0 estimated?

The graph above (which is repeated below) showed that there is not much variation in the number of 'infected' as a function of $R_0$, and the data of the number of infected people is not providing much information about $R_0$ (except whether or not it is above or below zero).

However, for the SIR model there is a large variation in the number of recovered or the ratio infected/recovered. This is shown in the image below where the model is plotted not only for the number of infected people but also for the number of recovered people. It is such information (as well additional data like detailed information where and when the people got infected and with whom they had contact) that allows the estimate of $R_0$.



Update

In your blog article you write that the fit is leading to a value of $R_0 \approx 2$. 

However that is not the correct solution. You find this value only because the optim is terminating early when it has found a good enough solution and the improvements for given stepsize of the vector $\beta, \gamma$ are getting small. 

When you use the nested optimization then you will find a more precise solution with a $R_0$ very close to 1. 

We see this value $R_0 \approx 1$ because that is how the (wrong) model is able to get this change in the growth rate into the curve.

This is a restriction of the SIR model which models $R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ where $\frac{1}{\gamma}$ is the period how long somebody is sick (time from Infected to Recovered) but that may not need to be the time that somebody is infectious. In addition, the compartment models is limited since the age of patients (how long one has been sick) is not taken into account and each age should be considered as a separate compartment.

But in any case. If the numbers from wikipedia are meaningfull (they may be doubted) then only 2% of the active/infected recover daily, and thus the $\gamma$ parameter seems to be small (no matter what model you use). 
",Accepted,"There are a few issues here, but I fear that the interpolation error of integration may be the least of them.

To start, if this work is done in a regulatory context one must use whatever procedures are required. So if there are regulatory requirements for how to estimate integration error then those take practical precedence. What follows ignores such regulations. First we'll examine the situation when the cost estimates have little or no error at the indicated event probabilities, then discuss how uncertainties in the costs and in other aspects of the modeling affect the estimated values of defenses at specified standards of protection.

If costs are known precisely

What you have displayed are the limits of the possible cost-probability curve if you know that the cost curve is non-increasing with increasing x-axis (probability) values. In this case that seems to be a reasonable assumption, as lower-probability events (higher flood stage) should have costs at least as large as higher-probability events (low or no flood stage).

The integrals estimated by the blue and red lines are Riemann sums, with the blue line providing a left Riemann sum and the red line a right Riemann sum. Your proposal to use those as outer limits for the inteterpolation error itself seems quite appropriate.

In general for smooth curves, the trapezoidal rule (which you presumably are using for your integration estimate, and is the average of the left and right Riemann sums) has a defined relationship between the integration error and a value of the second derivative of the cost-probability curve somewhere within the limits of integration. So if you can assume reasonable limits for the second-derivative values, that could set limits to the integration error. For the direction of systematic error, if you can assume that the curve is convex you know that your interpolation will over-estimate the true area.

Convexity and limits on second-derivative values might, however, not be good assumptions for flood costs. For example, there could be a fairly fast jump in costs as flood stage reached the level of first-story floors, and then another jump as flood stage reached the level of second-story floors. So convexity and assumptions about limits on second-derivative values would be questionable. That could also make it risky to try to fit a smooth curve to the set of data pairs and calculate the area analytically from the equation for the smooth curve.

So if the costs are known precisely then the limits you propose seem to be the best you can get in general for the limits of the area under the curve between the specified x-axis limits. 

With uncertainty in the costs

Estimating integration error due to interpolation does not deal with an additional source of uncertainty: the uncertainty in the y-axis cost estimates. A statistician would want to see error estimates for each of those cost values and would want you to take those error estimates into account to get a better measure of the actual error in your estimate of the value of the integral.

This is a particular problem with flood damage prediction. The x-axis probabilities typically represent the probability per year of a flood that is greater than a specified level (stage) above normal water levels. The damage associated with a particular stage may be affected by other aspects of the flood besides its level, such as its velocity or duration, adding additional uncertainty to damage estimates at any flood stage. This report compares different approaches to estimating flood risk; some simply ignore the uncertainties in stage and cost, some sample from probability distributions for certain of these estimates, and some model with event-based catastrophe models instead of continuous probability estimates.

This answer shows how errors in the estimates of y-axis values affect the estimates of integrals interpolated by the trapezoidal rule, in situations where the errors of the values at different event probabilities are uncorrelated. This simply follows the rules for variance of a weighted sum.

To get an idea of the relative contributions of interpolation and imprecise cost estimates to overall integration error, consider the integral under the curve between two event stages with cumulative probabilities (x-axis values) $p_0$ and $p_1$ ($p_0 &lt; p_1$; $p_1-p_0=\Delta p$), having associated costs of $C_0$ and $C_1$ ($C_0 &gt; C_1$).

Interpolation error. The trapezoidal rule gives an area $ (C_0 + C_1) \Delta p /2$. The upper limit of area given by the left Riemann sum is $C_0 \Delta p$, for an upper-limit difference for error above the trapezoidal estimate of $(C_0-C_1)\Delta p /2$.

Errors in $C_i$. If the variances of the $C_i$ values are $\sigma_i^2$ and the $C_i$ are uncorrelated, then the trapezoidal interpolation has an associated variance of $(\sigma_0^2 + \sigma_1^2)\Delta p^2/4$, or a standard error of $\sqrt{(\sigma_0^2 + \sigma_1^2)}\Delta p/2$.

So if the curve is relatively steep compared to the errors in the cost estimates then the interpolation error of the area will dominate. Areas over comparatively flatter parts of the curve, perhaps typical of higher-probability stages, may have integration errors dominated by the errors in the cost estimates. Similar application of the formula for the variance of a weighted sum provide the errors in the left and right Riemann sums that you propose as upper and lower estimates of integration error per se.

Other uncertainties in modeling

The full cost/benefit comparison involves more than estimating the annual benefit of installing the defense. This report shows how discount rates (to translate future gains into net present values) and expected project life are also incorporated into the calculation. There is the possibility that past history of flood probabilities does not adequately represent the future. Furthermore, future development (or abandonment) of structures in the flood plain will affect the value of installing the defense. Uncertainties in any of these estimates will add to the uncertainty in the full cost/benefit comparison.

6010,453792,Is there a way to calculate the riskiest places to be infected by COVID-19?,"Is there a way to calculate the riskiest places to be infected by COVID-19? My friends and I are having an argument of whether being in a ""high traffic-short contact time"" situation (public transport) vs ""low traffic-high contact time"" situation (e.g. place of worship/seminar) is more risky to be infected. 

I know it's wise to avoid all of such situations in the practice. But I want to find a way to calculate it even if it requires assigning dummy/guesswork numbers for unknown probability. Where do I begin?
",453797,"First of all,

The computation is very theoretic and not a good representation or guideline for adapting your behavior (just in case, if that is what you are after). In the comments I had already mentioned several points of critique for this approach:


The problem is that these computations will be based on highly subjective estimates about the underlying model/assumptions. Yes, you can compute it.... But do not expect that the answer is rigorous just because it has used mathematics
Another problem is that the descriptions of contacts are very complex. How exactly are you gonna be in the description of the 'time of contact'? Are you differentiating just the time of contact or also the type of contact? It is not a deterministic model and you need to deal with with distributions and stochastic behaviour that will make computations more difficult.

See for example the report about transmission of SARS in airplanes: there were three cases described with an infected person on board. In one case tens of other passengers got infected. In the other two cases it was only one other person (a crew member) that got infected. 
In addition, are you gonna describe the probability for a single person, or the probability for the public health? In high traffic the probability for a single individual might be low but due to the large number of individuals in those situations there might be a probability that at least one or more persons get infected. 

For public health, the problem is not to compare cases based on the probabilities for individuals to become sick. But instead, the point is to reduce the probability for individuals spreading the virus, make others sick. In general those probabilities (to make others sick) are much higher with high traffic cases. Sick people should not be around many other people.

There are many of these strange probability effects around. For instance, in Europe there is a lot of focus on people who had contact with the high risk areas; and it seems to be ignored that one may acquire the virus locally as well.  
Indeed, when considering only a contact with a single person, then it is more likely to obtain the virus if this person is from (or had contact with) a high risk area. However, due to the much larger number of contacts with people outside the risk area it may be more likely to acquire the virus from one of those people, albeit the fact that the risk per contact is lower.  Still, it is not illogical to focus on the high risk areas. But that is more a consideration from the point of view of focusing the limited time, money and materials. Yes, it is more likely to get the coronavirus from somebody that is not from the risk area's. But there are many other viruses from which one may obtain a common cold and we can not deal with all of those cases. When we wish to focus efforts on the most important cases, then the consideration is for which people the common cold is most likely to be due to the coronavirus. In that case it is linked to the high risk areas. 




A possible solution (based on a simple model),

Let's consider the (unrealistic) probability of obtaining an infection, conditional on the other person being sick (this is a bit complex, there are different levels of being sick but let's consider this for single cases).

Say, the probability 'to get sick from a single contact of time $t$' is a function of contact time according to some (sort of) homogeneous Poisson process (ie. the waiting time to get hit/sick depends on an exponentially distributed variable and the longer the contact the more likely to get sick) 

$$P(\text{sick from contact time $t$}) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}$$

If you encounter $n$ people, each for a time $t$, sampled from a population of which $p\%$ are sick...


then the number of sick people, $S$, that you encounter is binomial distributed $$P(S=s) = {{n}\choose{s}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}$$
the probability of getting sick from those $S$ people is: $$P(\text{sick} \vert t,s) = 1- e^{-\lambda ts}$$
the marginal probability of getting sick is $$\begin{array}{}
P(\text{sick} \vert t, n) &amp; = &amp; \sum_{s=0}^n
\overset{{\substack{\llap{\text{probability}}\rlap{\text{ to encounter}} \\ 
\llap{\text{$s$ sick }}\rlap{\text{people}}  }}}{\overbrace{P(S=s)}^{}}
 \times \underset{{\substack{\llap{\text{probability to  }}\rlap{\text{get sick}} \\ \llap{\text{conditional}} \rlap{\text{ on}} \\ \llap{\text{encountering $s$}} \rlap{\text{ sick people}}
}}}{\underbrace{P(\text{sick} \vert t,s)}_{}} \\ \\
&amp;=&amp; 1- \sum_{s= 0}^n {{s}\choose{n}} p^s(1-p)^{n-s}e^{-\lambda ts} \\ &amp;=&amp; 1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t}\right)^n 
\end{array}$$ where I solved this last term with wolframalpha.


Note that 

$$\lim_{n\to \infty} 1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t/n}\right)^n = 1 - e^{-\lambda t p} $$

For a given fixed total contact  $C = n\times t \times \lambda$ you get an increase as function of $n$. For instance, if $C = 10$ then:



Intuitive overview

Below are two graphs that show the value of this term $1- \left(1- p + pe^{-\lambda t}\right)^n $ as function of contact time $t$ and number of contacts $n$. The plots are made for different values of $p$.

Note the following regions:


On the right side the contact time is very large and you are almost certainly gonna get infected if the person that you have contact with is sick. More specifically for the lower right corner (if $n=1$ and $t$ is very large) the probability of getting sick will be equal to $p$ (ie. the probability that the other person is sick). 
More generally for the right side, the region where $\lambda t&gt;1$, a change in the contact time is not gonna change much the probability to get sick from a single person (this curve $1-e^{-\lambda t}$ doesn't change much in value for large $\lambda t$).

So if $\lambda t&gt;1$ (and you are almost certainly getting sick if the other person is sick) then if you halve the contact time and double the number of contacts, then this is gonna increase the probability to get sick (because the probability to encounter a sick person increases).
On the left side for $\lambda t &lt; 1$ you will get that at some point an increase of $n$ with an equal decrease of $t$ will counter each other. On the left side it doesn't matter whether you have high traffic short time vs. low traffic high time.








Conclusion

So, say you consider total contact time $n\times t$ being constant, then this should lead to a higher probability for getting sick for higher $n$ (shorter contacts but with more people). 

Limitations

However the assumptions will not hold in practice. The time of contact is an abstract concept and also the exponential distribution for the probability of getting sick from a single person is not accurate.


Possibly there might be something like contact being more/less intense in the beginning (to compare in the simple model the probability to get sick from a single contact of time $t$ is approximately linear in time $1-e^{\lambda t} \approx \lambda t$)
Also when considering infections of groups, instead of individuals, then there might be correlations like when a sick person sneezes then it will hit multiple people at the same time. Think about the cases of superspreaders, e.g. the case of the SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex where likely a single person infected hundreds of others)


So based on the simple model there is this effect that of for a given total time of contact, $n \times t$, is better to spread it out among less people, $n$. 
However, there is an opposite effect. At some point, for short $t$, the transmission will be relatively unlikely. For instance, a walk on a busy street means high $n$ but the contacts will not be meaningful to create a high risk. (Potentially you could adapt this first equation $1 - e^{\lambda t}$ but it is very subjective/broad). You could think like something as the '5 seconds rule' (which is actually not correct but gets close to the idea).

Use of the simple model

Although the model used here is very simplistic, it does still help to get a general idea about what sort of measures should be taken and how the principle would work out for a more complex model (it will be more or less analogous to the simple model): 

On the right side (of the image), it doesn't help much to change (reduce) the contact time, and it is more important to focus on reducing the number of contacts (e.g. some of the rigorous advise for non-sick family-members that are in quarantine together with sick family members are not much useful since restricting $\lambda t$ for large $\lambda t$ has little effect and it would be better to focus on making less contacts; go cook yourself instead of ordering that pizza)

On the left side, reductions should be weighed against each other. When restrictions that reduce high traffic are gonna lead to low traffic but a longer time then the measures are not gonna help a lot. 

A very clear example: I am currently waiting in line to enter the supermarket. They have decided to reduce the number of total people inside the supermarket. But this is entirely useless and possibly detrimental. The total time that we are in contact with other people does not decrease because of this. (And there are secondary effects: partners alone at home with children that have to wait longer. Potential shopping at multiple markets because time is limited at single markets. Etc. It is just silly)

I am letting the older people in the line pass before me since the health effects may be worse for them. And in the meantime I make myself annoyed about this symbolical useless measure (if not even detrimental) and have sufficient time to type this edit in this post, and in the meantime either make other people sick or become sick myself.
",Accepted,"When you write ""score ~ (1|school/trial/service)"" this treats service as a random effect, nested within trial, nested within school.

From your description, it sounds like service may actually be a fixed effect? If so, then I think you would want ""score ~ service + (1|school/trial) + (1|school/trail:service)"" - that gives you a fixed main effect for service, and a random effect for the interaction of service with trial-nested-within-school.

The answer above assumes service is categorical. If service is continuous, you will need a random slope for the interaction instead of random intercepts, eg. ""score ~ service + (1|school/trial) + (service|school/trail)"". This is not an interaction in the sense that you'll get an output value, but it does account for differing effects of service (as a continuous variable) in different trial-nested-within-school groups.

Of course, ets() will not know when to stop extrapolating the exponential growth, so this (extremely correct) rationale applies equally to ets(). You may want to consider models that are explicitly tailored towards epidemiology or (market) penetration, like the Bass diffusion model or similar.

",Accepted,"You're right that this is a very difficult problem--it's hard to test independence in general without a lot of data. There are loads of test statistics you can construct and test to try to reject the null hypothesis of i.i.d. samples, but unless you guess the mechanism of the dependence correctly or have a huge sample size, such statistics (like you describe in your problem) can have very low power.

If $U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n$ are ""random"" integers, you could do a chi-square test of independence on sequences of a given length $k$. Then you've got $n-k$ observed sequences, and each should occur with probability $10^{-k}$.

Suppose you have some a priori knowledge of the dependence; for instance, you suspect that an adversary is trying to make the sequence look independent to the human eye, and so they make sure every number in the sequence is different from the last. Then using $k=2$ in the previous paragraph will uncover the dependence, because the 10 ""doubles"" will never appear in the sequence and the chi-square test for independence will reject.

6288,454684,Mother milk of 6 Corona-positive (COVID-19) women does not contain the virus - can we make a confidence statement about this?,"I am asking this question because I believe it would be great if the statistics community could make a contribution to solving this serious puzzle until more evidence is available. 

The UK Royal Office of Obstetricians and Gynecologists publishes guidelines on neonatal and prenatal treatment of Corona positive women and babies of Corona positive women. There is insufficient evidence to give an advice whether breastfeeding is safe in the sense of not passing virus from mother to child via the mother milk. There are other infection ways but mother milk could be expressed and fed while keeping distance, e.g. by father.

A source is quoted in the guidelines (p. 27) that 6 Chinese women's breast milk was tested Corona negative; that is, six of out six samples were negative. If we consider these tests independent events, where the event is to sample a woman who passes the virus via the mothermilk, we have a binomial trial.

Which confidence or credibility statements can we make about the probability to pass on the virus to the mother milk? This probability is estimated at zero in this trial, of course. 

Some statements can be made; for example if the probability was 0.50 the likelihood of the data would be 0.015. If it approaches 0, the likelihood approaches 1, but it is not differentiable at zero, so standard likelihood inference fails.

Please note: The same guidelines advise in section 4.8.2 to continue breastfeeding by COVID-19 positive women: ' In the light of the current evidence, we advise that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. The risks and benefits of breastfeeding, including the risk of holding the baby in close
proximity to the mother, should be discussed with her.' (p. 27)

  if a certain event did not occur in a sample with $n$ subjects, the interval from $0$ to $3/n$ is a 95% confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the population.

",Accepted,"AFAIK, bootstrapping is for getting the standard error estimates. If you want to validate models, look at N-fold cross-validation, or leave-one-out crossvalidation (jacknife).

EDIT: since you said that years are not serially correlated, this simplifies your situation a lot! You can then treat the years as if they were just data points, and select the testing sets totally randomly. You can do e.g. 3-fold crossvalidation by splitting the data in 3 randomly selected set of years, run the model 3 times (see how N-fold cross-validation works), and then put together all the 3 independently predicted testing sets from those 3 models and evaluate them with the Nash-sutcliffe coefficient, which seems to be a good measure of the model efficiency.

Chose the model with the best coefficient. Cross-validation assures  that you do not overfit in those single models tested. However, since during the model selection procedure itself you use the whole dataset, there is a risk that you can overfit in that model selection procedure itself, if you overdo it, as fittingly pictured in the chart below:



So, be careful not to select among too many model variants. Another way could be to put apart yet another validation set to monitor how are you doing in the model selection procedure itself :)

",454983,"One of the differences is the likelihoods for each model.  In case readers can't remember, the likelihood encapsulates assumptions about the conditional distribution of the data.  In the case of COVID-19, this would be the distribution of infections (or reported new cases, or deaths, etc) on the given day.  Whatever we want the outcome to be, let's call it $y$.  Thus, the conditional distribution (e.g. the number of new cases today) would be $y\vert t$ (think of this as $y$ conditioned on $t$).


In the case of taking the log and then performing lm, this would mean that $\log(y)\vert t \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \sigma^2) $.  Equivalently, that $y$ is lognormal given $t$. The reason we do linear regression on $\log(y)$ is because on the log scale, the conditional mean is independent of the variance, where as the mean of the log normal is also a function of the variance. So Pro: we know how to do linear regression, but Con This approach makes linear regression assumptions on the log scale which can always be assessed but might be hard to theoretically justify?  Another con is that people do not realize that predicting on the log scale and then taking the exponential actually biases predictions by a factor if $\exp(\sigma^2/2)$ if I recall correctly.  So when you make predictions from a log normal model, you need to account for this.  
So far as I understand, nls assumes a Gaussian likelihood as well, so in this model $ y \vert t \sim \mathcal{N}(\exp(\beta_0 + \beta t), \sigma^2)$.  Except now, we let the conditional mean of the outcome be non-linear.  This can be a pain because no confidence intervals are not bounded below by 0, so your model might estimate a negative count of infections.  Obviously, that can't happen.  When the count of infections (or whatever) is larger, then a Gaussian can justifiable.  But when things are just starting, then this probably isn't the best likelihood.  Furthermore, if you fit your data using nls, you'll see that it fits later data very well but not early data.  That is because misfitting later data incurrs larger loss and the goal of nls is to minimize this loss.
The approach with glm frees is a little and allows us to control the conditional distribution as well as the form of the conditional mean through the link function. In this model, $y \vert t \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu(x), \phi)$ with $\mu(x) = g^{-1}(\beta_0 + \beta_1)$.  We call $g$ the link, and for the case of log link $\mu(x) = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 t)$. Pro These models are much more expressive, but I think the power comes from the ability to perform inference with a likelihood which is not normal.  This lifts a lot of the restrictions, for example symmetric confidence intervals. The Con is that you need a little more theory to understand what is going on.

",Accepted,"I suggest you think carefully about the context of the question in practice. 

You could model the source and destination as GPS coordinates rather than streets and house numbers. In this case your outcome will be two numbers: the x and the y coordinate.
Your approach would require multi-class classification and one way to encode the outcome would be as a one-hot encoded matrix.

If there are many source and destination values, then the curse of dimensionality is a valid concern. Some algorithms are designed to handle many categorical dimensions, e.g. catBoost. The underlying idea here is to replace each level in the categorical variable by a noisy average of the target variable for that level. That turns a categorical variable into a single continuous variable.

The other state-of-the-art approach is use separate input layers for categorical variables in a neural network, a model structure know as embedding (layers). The embedding layer reduces the large dimensionality into a lower dimensional representation that serves as input to the prediction layer/linear model. This has been shown to be effective in a taxi competition on Kaggle 

EDIT: Twelve unique source destination are likely not an issue w.r.t dimensionality. The above solutions handle categories in the hundreds or thousands.

Is it possible to estimate the intercept from the significant, multivariable model coefficients published(Table 3 at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3)?
",454993,"No, for a few reasons.  The most relevant is that, even if you could numerically determine the value of the intercept term in the model, you would not be able to tell what conditions are represented by the intercept term of the model fit by the researchers (unless they provided some very specific details about their methods, e.g., ""did they center their predictors"", etc.).

The way these models are defined, you need to know what the ""reference"" point of each coefficient is.  By convention the reference point for continuous variables is often zero, but the choice of reference is completely arbitrary for categorical variables (though it does appear to be stated in the article).

On a more conceptual note, models like this one are often limited in their ability to predict accurate ""class probabilities ""because their goal is to explain relationships between predictors, or to describe relative risk-reducing or risk-increasing relationships among the predictors in the model.  Often these models use only a limited number of variables to arrive at a parsimonious model, which tries to keep multicollinearity low, so that the individual effects of predictors are easier to interpret.  

Another way of looking at it is this:  The model may have been designed to address research questions  such as: ""what is the relative importance of age with respect to the risk of an in-hospital death after controlling for other demographic factors?"".  Even if the model does this very well, it may be very bad at answering fundamentally different questions, such as ""What is the probability that a female will experience an in-hospital death?""

http://depts.washington.edu/labmed/covid19/
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-outcomes.html

Can someone suggest a branch of statistics or papers for further study that would help me assess the veracity of such claims? My intuitive reasoning, as described below, shows why I am questioning the optimistic interpretation, but I would like to learn a more formalized framework.



For instance, let's say that the population proportion that tests positive for an attribute is 7%, and that proportion is stable. If I took a random sample each day, I should be getting 7% consistently, subject to some variance.

However, let's say the population proportion is subject to change over time. Let's also add the assumption that I am trying to prioritize sampling people (without replacement) that I believe are most likely to be positive. Eventually I will sample the whole population. Under these new assumptions, if the population proportion were stable, you would expect my initial sample proportions to overshoot, and my final sample proportions to under shoot as I ran out of likely positives. That would imply that if my sample proportion was constant and did NOT drift down over time, then my population proportion MUST be increasing over time. And if my sample proportion was increasing over time, then my population proportion must be increasing by a heck of a lot over time.

These are just qualitative conclusions I can come to. Is there a branch of statistics I can learn about to help me make concrete conclusions about a changing population proportion given sample proportions over time? I am sure that as you vary the sample size across time, the conclusions also change. Any framework to help understand the tweaks and their effects would be great.

Thank you.
",455087,"OK, the service area is likely many hundreds of thousands for the U of Washington and for certain patients covers a five state area. The detection rate for a tertiary/quaternary referral center reflects the patient selection process, same criteria for referring patients in distress might lead to same detection rate. However, more precisely one cannot make inferences on that basis because the criteria for patient selection for testing is an uncontrolled variable.

To explain this a bit more, a primary or community hospital would refer patients to a larger regional hospital which refers patients to a specialized tertiary care hospital, and for certain problems, tertiary care hospitals would send patients to a quaternary care facility. Even more complicated, a local physician in the community, might refer a patient directly to a quaternary care facility, or the patient might walk in to the emergency room off of the street.  So, there are so many confounders that any correlation  you might make risks being spurious.

The white contour lines correspond to the conditional (Gaussian) density obtained from conditioning on the given height, so, e.g., the bottom line is the density for weights given a height of 140 (cm, I'd guess).

I understand it is best practice to avoid asking for specific data sets here, so I will keep my question as generic as possible and ask for leniency:

Does anyone know how to find (or search for) recent mortality statistics? Ideally this would be ""per day per country up to today"", but even ""a total for February in a continent or city would already be insightful"".



What have I tried so far: 


Searching recent mortality, this only results in virus related statistics
Searching for several countries or WHO, this did not result in anything for this year

",455219,"It doesn't seem like the death toll is clearly showing up (yet). 

For instance, Europe has almost up to 10 000 deaths in a single day during the peak of a heavy respiratory season, and the Covid-19 cases will only be a small bump, in relation to the overall burden of disease.

But, that would be playing down the impact of the virus. It is difficult to look at the overall death rate. Many people are dying every day. We can not easily compare a single cause to the total amount of deaths that are occurring.

Important to consider is that Covid-19 deaths have a non-homogeneous spatial distribution and locally there's a high density that's not clear in common (public) databases that (mostly) present aggregate numbers. Also, the outbreak is still young and is not yet fully processed in databases. So with better data we might be better able to see the impact of the disease (I suspect that the agencies have better information).

So the fact that we currently see little influence of Covid-19 on aggregated statistics of death rate is not reassuring because it is meaningless to look at aggregated statistics (this depends a bit on your philosophy about nature and death though, personally I feel we are overreacting, but that is completely different from statistics). 

See also this note from EuroMomo


  Note concerning COVID-19 related mortality as part of the all-cause mortality figures reported by EuroMOMO
  
  Over the past few days, the EuroMOMO hub has received many questions about the weekly all-cause mortality data and the possible contribution of any COVID-19 related mortality. Some wonder why no increased mortality is observed in the reported mortality figures for the COVID-19 affected countries.
  The answer is that increased mortality that may occur primarily at subnational level or within smaller focal areas, and/or concentrated within smaller age groups, may not be detected at the overall national level. This even more so in the pooled European-wide analysis, given the large total population denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.
  Therefore, although increased mortality is currently not being observed in the EuroMOMO figures, this does not mean that increased mortality does not occur in some areas or in some age groups, including mortality related to COVID-19.

",Accepted,"Why are errors correlated in the reduced-form VAR?
If the error covariance matrix were restricted to be diagonal in the reduced form, the model would be too restrictive to adequately represent most of real-world time series. You could specify such a restricted model, but the assumption of diagonal covariance matrix would often be violated in practice.

Why are errors uncorrelated in the structural VAR?
Structural VAR with contemporaneous effects and uncorrelated errors is another representation of the same reduced-form VAR model. For convenience of interpretation, the structural representation is defined by lack of error correlation. Other representations with contemporaneous effects but correlated errors are possible but are less interesting.

",457259,"This is actually a handbook example of determining the sample size needed for estimating binomial proportion (e.g. Jones et al, 2004, Naing, 2003 for other references and examples).

First of all, to make it more precise, we are talking about finding such sample size, that with probability $\alpha$, the difference between the true probability of being infected $p$ and it's estimate $\hat p$ is not greater then $(100\times\delta\,)\%$

$$
\Pr(|p - \hat p| \le \delta p) = \alpha
$$

Given that the target population is large, we would usually assume binomial distribution to represent it, i.e. we say that it is large enough, that the chance of randomly sampling someone more then once is negligible. The distribution is parametrized by probability of ""success"" (here, probability of being infected) $p$ and the number of samples we draw $n$. Let's denote the observed number of infected people as $k$, in such case, $\hat p = k/n$ is the fraction of infected people in the sample and we treat it as an estimate of the number of infected people in the whole population. If we wanted to calculate confidence interval for $\hat p$, we could use normal approximation

$$
\hat p \pm z_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}
$$

where $z_\alpha$ is the ordinate from standard normal distribution, where for $z$ drawn from standard normal distribution we have $\Pr(-z_\alpha &lt; z &lt; z_\alpha) = \alpha$. You are saying, that you'd like to see this interval to be equal to $\hat p \pm \delta p$. As discussed in the linked resources, you can solve this, so that for given $p$, precision $\delta$, and certanity $\alpha$, you can guesstimate the sample size needed

$$
n \approx \Big(\frac{z_\alpha}{\delta p}\Big)^2 \; p(1-p)
$$

Assuming $(100 \times \alpha)\% = 99\%$ confidence interval, we can plot this for different values of $p$, to find out that for $100 \times p &gt; 4 \%$ the needed sample sizes are generally not much larger then $2000$ samples.



For example, for $p=0.04$ ($4\%$ infected) this yields:



&gt; z &lt;- function(alpha) qnorm(alpha)
&gt; n &lt;- function(p, alpha=0.99, delta=0.25) (z(alpha)/(p*delta))^2 * p*(1-p)
&gt; n(0.04)
[1] 2078.167


To convince yourself, you can verify this by simulation, where you would draw $n$ samples from binomial distribution with probability of infection $p$, repeat this procedure $R$ times, and then verify how often was your result not further then $(100 \times \delta) \%$ from the true value:

&gt; set.seed(123)
&gt; sim &lt;- function(p, n, delta, nsim=50000) mean(abs(p - rbinom(nsim, n, p)/n) / p &lt;= delta)
&gt; sim(0.04, 2078, 0.25)
[1] 0.97858


So we wanted to be $99\%$ sure and the approximation gives us, while the in the simulation, in $97.8\%$ cases the result was within the interval. Not bad.

Notice that this is just a simple approximation for the calculation, assuming simple random sampling. In case of whole population locked in their houses, sampling individuals at random may be not as hard as in case of most of the usual surveys. On another hand, things may not go as smooth as planned, or you may be willing to use other sampling schema, to have higher chance for it being representative, what would make calculating it more complicated. Moreover, the tests used aren't perfect and give false results as described, for example by New York Times, or Washington Post, and you'd need to account for that as well. Also you need to remember, there were many examples where such simple problems get more complicated then expected, e.g. social surveys on Trump's support before the election got very wrong, nonetheless that they used state of art survey methodology.
",Accepted,"What you are seeing is exactly what one would expect. The condition number of your matrix $X$ is about $10^6$. Double precision floating point calculations give about 18 figures of accuracy so, in double precision, you would expect to get at most $18-6=12$ significant figures for the estimated coefficients from QR and at most $18-6-6=6$ significant figures from Choleski, after allowing for accuracy lost due to conditioning.
(Choleski loses twice the number of significant figures because forming $X^TX$ squares the condition number.)
Hence the coefficients from the two algorithms should start to differ in the 6th significant figure, which is exactly what you see. Your results show that for x2 the relative difference between the two algorithms is about
$$ 0.2 / 148232 = 1.35 \times 10^{-6},$$
which matches the condition number you started out with surprisingly well.

The condition number of $X$ is a reasonable guide to precision when the residuals are small. If we make sure that the exact coefficients are 1 and 1.00001 by

&gt; y &lt;- X %*% c(1,1.00001)


and rerun your calculation we get

&gt; result
                 chol                qr
x1 0.9999833544961814 0.999999999968327
x2 1.0000266455870466 1.000010000031673


confirming that QR is in fact correct to 12 significant figures and Choleski is correct to 6 significant figures.

The fitted values from Choleski are generally more precise than the estimated coefficients. If the fitted values are more important to you than the coefficients, and that will often be so in a highly collinear cases, then Choleski is usually fine.
Choleski is also about as good as QR when the residuals are very large, but this is the hardest case for both algorithms.
My PhD supervisor was Australia's foremost numerical analysis (Mike Osborne) and he used to say that Choleski was not as bad as it's made out to be.

The full sensitivity analysis for Choleski vs QR is given in Section 5.3.8 of Golub and Van Loan (1996), and is very much more complex than the simple calculation I used above. The sensitivity of Choleski is roughly proportion to $\kappa + \rho \kappa^2$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number of $X$ and $\rho$ is a theoretical quantity that is almost impossible to compute in practice.
$\rho$ depends on the size of the residuals-- it is roughly proportional to but much smaller than the average squared residual.
The sensitivity of QR is somewhat better than Choleski although not always as good as I have suggested above. Golub and Van Loan remark:


  At the very minimum, this discussion should convince you how difficult it can be to choose the ""right"" algorithm!

1 Derivation of the LS estimator

1.1 definitions


Let's consider the dataset $D_T\triangleq\{y_0,\dots,y_T\}$ up to the observation horizon $T$, where $y_t\triangleq[S_t, I_t, R_t, D_t]'$ is the vector of the observed values at time $t$ for the variables $S,I,R,D$. Here $'$ denotes the transpose operation, thus $y_t$ is a column vector in $\mathbb{N}^{4\times1}$;
Let $\theta\triangleq[\alpha, \beta, \gamma]'$ be the generic vector of parameters. The prediction model $\hat{y}_t(\theta)$ is $(1)$, so
$$\tag{2}
    \hat{y}_t(\theta)\triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}  \\ 
    I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\  
    D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots   
$$
with the convention that $\hat{y}_0(\theta)\triangleq 0$;
Let $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ the quadratic cost up to $T$. Here $\| \cdot \|$ denotes the euclidian norm. The least square estimator $\theta_\text{LS}$ of the 'real' parameter $\bar{\theta}$ is defined as
$$\tag{3}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
i.e. the minimum for the cost $V_T$.


1.2 analitic solution of $(3)$ 

the idea to solve $(3)$ is to use the standard technique by solving with respect to $\theta$ the equation
$$\tag{4}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta}=0$$
the solution is a minimum for $V_T$ since $(3)$ is a convex problem under mild assumptions regarding the dataset $D_T$ (invertibility of the next matrix $R_T$ defined below). In order to solve $(4)$, let's start by observing that the prediction model $(2)$ is linear in their parameters. In fact we can write that
$$\tag{5}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
by introducing the regression matrices in $\mathbb{R^{4\times3}}$
$$\tag{6}\varphi_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -I_{t-1} &amp; -I_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}I_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
with the conventions that $\varphi_0, y_{-1}=0$. From $(5)$ it follows straightforward that the gradient of the cost $V_T$ is
$$\tag{7}\begin{align}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} &amp;= \sum_{t=0}^T - \frac{\partial \hat{y}_t (\theta)}{\partial \theta}[y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta)]\\
&amp;=-\sum_{t=0}^T \varphi_t'[y_t-(\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1})] \\
&amp;=\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'[\varphi_t \theta - \Delta y_t] \\
&amp;=\left(\sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t\right)\theta - \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t
\end{align}$$ 
where $\Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}$. If we introduce the matrix $R_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ and the vector $\tilde{\theta}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
$$\tag{8}R_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t '\varphi_t \qquad \tilde{\theta}_T\triangleq \sum_{t=1}^T \varphi_t'\Delta y_t$$
the gradient in $(7)$ gets the following final sintetic expression
$$\tag{9}\frac{\partial V_T(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = R_T\theta-\tilde{\theta}_T$$
now, by combining $(4)$ with $(9)$ and by resolving with respect $\theta$, we can finally conclude that the least square estimator that we are searching is
$$\tag{10}\boxed{\theta_\text{LS}=R_T^{-1}\tilde{\theta}_T}$$

2 Naive implementation in Python

2.1 dataset

I want to estimate $\bar{\theta}$ for the COVID-19 epidemy in Italy, so I've built the  dataset by retrieving from worldometers.info the number of infected $I_t$, recovered $R_t$ and dead $D_t$ individuals day by day. Since $S_t+I_t+R_t+D_t=N$ is costant in time, the number of susceptibles day by day is $S_t=N-(I_t+R_t+D_t)$.  

2.2 least squares estimation of the parameters

in order to compute $(10)$, we need: 


to build $\varphi_t$ and $\Delta y_t$. For the former we can use the definition $(6)$, for the latter we can observe that
$$\tag{11} \Delta y_t \triangleq y_t-y_{t-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
    S_t-S_{t-1}  \\ 
    I_t-I_{t-1}  \\  
    R_t-R{t-1} \\  
    D_t-D_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$ 
to build $R_T$ and $\tilde{\theta}_T$. The idea to compute $(8)$ is to accumulate during the time the products $\varphi_t ' \varphi_t$ and $\varphi_t '\Delta y_t$.


After this 2 simple step the estimation is given by $(10)$.

2.3 simulation  

for the simulation we use the prediction model $(1)$ with the least squares parameters that we have just found. For the initial condition of the simulation I consider the situation where in the population there is only one infected individual that spreads the  disease to the other people.

$$\begin{cases}
S_{0}&amp;=N-1 \\ 
I_{0}&amp;=1 \\
R_{0}&amp;=0 \\
D_{0}&amp;=N-(S_0+I_0+R_0) \\
\end{cases}$$
here the starting number of dead individuals is obtained by imposing the costraint $S_0+I_0+R_0+D_0=N$.

Your equation number 5 should be

$$\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$

instead of

$$\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$

Also you compute the derivative $\varphi$ based on the matrix that contains values of $S, I ,R, D$ that are the observed values, but $\varphi$ should relate to the modeled values.

I am not sure whether you can continue your attempt to solve this analytically after correcting those mistakes. It looks a bit like how people solve equations with the finite element method and potentially you could solve it in that way as well (but it will be an approximation in terms of polynomial functions, and is not exact). 

Another way to solve it is to put the equations as a function, and have some solver optimize it (you can have the solver estimate the gradient). You can read about that here: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge

In addition: You can recast the equations into a single differential equation. For the SIR model this is demonstrated here:

Tiberiu Harko, Francisco S. N. Lobo, M. K. Mak  Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates arXiv:1403.2160 [q-bio.PE]

The SIRD model is almost analogous. It is nearly the same model, with only the R split up in two. So you can use this differential equation to make initial estimates of parameters. 



Also

Fitting this kind of data to some model might be a bad idea. The SIR type of models are some sort of logistic growth type models where the growth starts approximately exponentially but eventually the growth rate decreases. It is due to such terms like $dI/dt = I * (factor)$ where the factor is decreasing as $I$ (and $R$ and $D$) grow (in the case of logistic growth the factor is $1-I$, for the SIRD model it a bit more sophisticated but not much different).

However, in the case of the corona epidemic, you get a decrease in the growth rate for a multitude of reasons.


Weather changes ($R_0$ is not a constant)
Spatial distribution (This virus spreads in from place to place, and should not be considered with compartmental models that assume homogeneous mixing; a person in Milan is much more likely to infect their family, neighbors, co-workers than a random person in the rest of Lombardy)
Stochastic Time effects. The article that you refer to tries to bring autocorrelation into the mixture, but you also have some stochastic behavior, people are not gonna get sick exactly at the same time. Some people will get sick earlier than others and this will be according to some function that increases in time and that will make an increase of cases or deaths that might appear as an exponential growth that relates to a transmission model, but it might be not. 
Sampling bias. We can also see rapid increase in the sampling due to biassed sampling. Definitions of the disease are changing (this gave a rapid bump in the curve for Chinese), tests might be limited (several countries are limiting their testing which might give false ideas of reduction in the growth of the cases), positive reinforcement (once people have discovered the disease suddenly many other cases might become assigned to the same cause, and this may potentially occur inaccurate because a single cause of death is not always possible to assign)

The last to points Sampling Bias and Stochastic time behavior might have occured in the outbreak of SARS (2003) in Amoy Gardens where hundreds of people got sick in a very short time frame. Instead of fitting a model to it, one could also assume that all these hundreds of cases were infected by a single person (and that might be a more likely scenario). Possibly such a situation may have occurred in Italy as well, an initial heavy seeding by unnoticed cases that is now spreading with some time effect and causes the initial exponential decrease (currently the growth looks more like a quadratic curve).
Last but not least, people respond to the virus which may cause it's spread to increase/decrease. Currently heavy measures have been taken and this restricts to a large extend the ability of the virus to spread. You can not model this with a model that has parameters that are constant in time (well, you can, but the outcome will be meaningless)


The logistic SIR type models will interpret all those reasons for a reduction in the growth rate as a reproduction rate very close to 1 or a low population parameter (you fixed it at the size of the population under study, but this is arbitrary, and also not everybody is gonna be susceptible, possibly many people might have some sort of immunity and get little infected, e.g. a Hoskin's effect or some other effect might make only/mostly the elderly population susceptible).

This makes the seemingly mechanistic model, meaningless regarding the parameters. The outcome will be unrealistic.
",Accepted,"What's happening is that R and Stata use quite different approaches to estimating the population standard deviation. R goes directly via the mean of $(X-\bar X)^2$ and Stata goes via an estimated standard error of the mean (under simple random sampling). 

As a result, Stata's estimate depends on values outside the subpopulation (as is unarguably correct for the standard error of the mean) and R's doesn't (as is at least arguably correct for the subpopulation standard deviation).  

For example, you can get the 2.198 in the Stata output as

&gt; sqrt(2.47162^2*571.16/139.77*6/31)
[1] 2.198105


where 2.47162 is the R estimate, 571.16 is the estimated population size (sum of weights), 139.77 is the estimated subpopulation size (sum of weights), 6 is 7-1 and 31 is 32-1. 

As you can see, it isn't easy to convert; it's probably easier to just implement the formula from the Stata manual if you want the Stata version.

Since a lot of people escaped their homes in panic, there were fears that the earthquake would cause an increase in the cases of coronavirus since people didn't obey the rules of social distancing when they escaped outside due to the earthquake.

The Director of the Croatian Institute for Public Health, Krunoslav Capak, said that they conducted some preliminary analyses that suggest that the earthquake didn't cause an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The analyses are preliminary becuase the incubation period of the virus is known to be as long as 14 days, so it's possible that the effect is not visible yet.

Regardless of the incubation period length, I was confused by Capak's statement because I cannot think of a statistical method I would use to make that inference. Does anyone know what analyses was Capak referring to? What statistical analyses would be appropriate to determine if there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Croatia due to the earthquake?

The number of coronavirus cases in Croatia can be found here: https://github.com/viborccom/data/blob/master/covid-19/croatia/time-series.csv?fbclid=IwAR2ekRN44WnKwlTQJAgpfYyJTz01GedrqJupB28d-g_KoGBnroIGWt8Jb58
",457922,"You might wonder whether an increased infection rate during a short period could be observed in the figures of reports on infected cases or the death rate.

However, this is not feasible with the data available


The effect get's diluted The effect is likely to be very small in the observations (unless the infection rate is very large). 


If there is an increase in transmission then this will occur only in a small group, which gets diluted by the larger total number of Zagreb and the surroundings. 
Also the time of the event is only very short and the contact between people is very local. Social distancing is 'the way to go', but it matters with which persons and how long you have contact. 

Complete strangers in a supermarket are much more a risk than your neighbors (if your neighbors got the virus than you are already at high risk to get the virus as well, being outside is not gonna change this a lot). There is a large multitude of ways how the virus can spread. If we are traveling a lot, moving around over long distances, then the virus is moving a large distance quickly and will infect a lot of people quickly. The local transmission is of less concern (in terms of speed of transmission, and flattening the curve, the local transmission is eventually determining how many people get sick. The long range transmission is determining how fast people get sick*).

Ad hoc ergo propter hoc Even if there is a change in the trend/growth in the number of infections or the number of death cases, then it will be very difficult to connect this observation to a specific event. There are too many variables that are changing such that it is not possible to draw strong conclusions about causal relationships based on correlations.

The current cases in Zagreb and Croatia are very small. So the number will be expected to rise, already without an earthquake. This rise will occur with lots of uncertainty**. The information and background information is so noisy that it is not possible to make a lot of sensible predictions.

See the past reports on the cases below. The curve is not a nice straight line and is varying in growth rate and bumpy. It is very difficult to make a specific relation between specific events and this curve. That is because the time between infection, start of symptoms, and start of registration/confirmation occurs with an unknown delay.


Time delay Also, there is a delay in reporting of the numbers. This makes the above effects count stronger. It will take two weeks before the effect of increased transmission is measurable. But at that time many more events have happened which may cause an effect as well. And also the time delay is a random value. What happens now in a single day, will not create a sudden peak of a single day two weeks later, but instead it gets spread out over multiple days and becomes less noticeable (and then there are also large high noise levels in the measurements which might be a fourth point). 
denominator. Furthermore, there is always a few weeks of delay in death registration and reporting. Hence, the EuroMOMO mortality figures for the most recent weeks must be interpreted with some caution.




*A simple model that shows how the reduction in the long-range transmission is having a strong effect and going on the streets and have local community spread is slightly less worrisome. I used the code from this answer which made used of a $R_0$ for short distance transmission and a $R_1$ for long distance transmission. I did two computations, one with $R_1 = 0.25 , R_0 = 2.25$ and one with one with $R_1 = 0 , R_0 = 2.5$. The total reproduction rate, $2.5$, is the same, but the models deviate quickly once the infection reaches the edges of the neighborhood.

**In the Netherlands the officials were counting on a very specific rise of cases in the Intensive Care. Now... they are surprised that it did not turn out to be that specific number and it is a larger number than predicted (they were expecting 1600 people in the Intensive Care at some date, and not this is gonna happen a week earlier than expected)

Me... I am surprised that they are surprised about the number turning out to be different. These sort of predictions should have been made with a very wide confidence interval indicating that there is very little certainty about the forecasts.

7336,459046,Parameter Estimation for the SIRD model via Kalman Filter,"0 Introduction

This is my third attempt in tuning a good prediction SIRD model for the COVID-19 outbreak. The model in question is the following:
$$\tag{12}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta I_{t-1}-\gamma I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$



0.1 first attempt

In my first try I've used for the estimation of the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ a very simple strategy by searching the least squares parameters that minimize the quadratic cost of the 1-step prediction along all the observation horizon. The complete dissertation of this problem is here (note: in this thread I will use the same notations that I've used in the cited thread).
The estimation problem is very easy to resolve, but leads to a result with very poor performances.



0.2 second attempt

As Sextus Empiricus suggests to me, using the 1-step prediction, i.e.
$$\tag{13}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\varphi_t \theta + y_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
is not a good idea because, once one has found the parameters, during the simulation phase the model haves to feedback the proper previous predictions. This means, in principle, that the right way to tune the parameters $\theta$ is to minimize some suitable cost function of the prediction errors generated by a ""batch"" predictor of the form
$$\tag{14}\hat{y}_t(\theta)=\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \theta + \hat{y}_{t-1} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0, 1, 2,\dots$$
where
$$\tag{15}\hat\varphi(\hat{y}_{t-1}) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
and $\hat{S}_{t-1}, \hat{I}_{t-1}$ are predictions (and not observed values) generated by the model. As a consequence, the new estimation problem 
$$\tag{16}\theta_\text{LS}\triangleq \arg\min_{\theta \in \mathbb{R^3}} V_T (\theta)$$
with the same quadratic cost $V_T(\theta)\triangleq \frac{1}{2}\sum _{t=0}^T \|y_t-\hat{y}_t(\theta) \|^2$ is not easy anymore because now the considered model $(14)$ is not linear in his parameter $\theta$.

To resolve $(16)$, under the suggestion Sextus Empiricus, I've chosen a numerical approach. More precisely, I've used a simple gradient descent equipped with Armijo's adaptive learning rate / step update, with a simple finite-difference approximation of the gradient. The optimization works pretty well, but from the starting guess $\theta_{\text{LS},0}=0$ converges to a parameter $\theta_{\text{LS},\infty}$ with a non-zero cost that doesn't satisfies me in the final simulation phase.

I've tried several different optimizations by using randomly different initializations $\theta_{\text{LS},0}$ (like a MultiStart global optimization policy) with even worse results. 



0.3 third attempt

I'm quite sure that the optimizer works well, so I believe that to improve the performance of the final simulator it is necessary to increase the expressivity of the model $(12)$.
To make a step ahead towards an acceptable solution, under the observations of Sextus Empiricus, now I want make an attempt where I increase the difficult of the estimation problem by relaxing the time-invariance hypothesis of the parameters. Thus, now I consider this more complicated model 
$$\tag{17}\begin{cases}
S_{t}&amp;=S_{t-1}-\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N} \\ 
I_{t}&amp;=I_{t-1}+\alpha_t\frac{S_{t-1}I_{t-1}}{N}-\beta_t I_{t-1}-\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
R_{t}&amp;=R_{t-1}+\beta_t I_{t-1} \\
D_{t}&amp;=D_{t-1}+\gamma_t I_{t-1} \\
\end{cases} \qquad \text{for} \,\, t=1,2,\dots$$
The actual ""dynamic"" estimation problem can be solved by using a Kalman filter.

note: as mentioned by Sextus Empiricus, another possible approach to the problem is to tune the parameters by using the explicit solution of the SIRD model. I don't want follow this way because, as a student in control system engineering, I'm interested in learn how to identify generic dynamical systems in their implicit state-space representations. The SIRD problem is a ""toy example"" that I'm trying to resolve better as possible in my quarantine free-time. 

1 Kalman Filtering

1.1 dynamic system model

Consider the following linear, time-variant and autonomous state-space model for a dynamic system 
$$\tag{18}\begin{cases} x_{t+1} &amp;= A_t x_t+w_t \\ y_t &amp;= C_t x_t+v_t \end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots$$
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state vector, $y \in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the output vector of the system and the parameters $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $C \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}$ are matrices. The signals $w\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $v\in \mathbb{R}^p$ are white noises characterized respectively by null mean values and covariances $Q\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$  and $R\in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, i.e.
$$\begin{align} w_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,Q_t) \\ v_t &amp;= \text{wn}(0,R_t) \end{align}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{19}$$



1.2 Kalman filter definition 

The Kalman filter is another dynamic system that estimates dynamically the state of the system $(18)$ by watching the model $(18)$ and a dataset $D\triangleq\{y_0, y_1, y_2, \dots\}$ of observed outputs. The estimation process is a recursion starting from the initial state $x_0$, that is unknown and modelled as a random variable with mean value $\hat{x_0}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and covariance $P_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, i.e.
$$\tag{20} x_0 \sim (\hat{x}_0, P_0)$$
At every time instant $t=1,2,3,\dots$ the recursion is splitted in two different steps:


correction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ of the state $x_t$ by considering all the observed past values $y_0,y_1, \dots, y_{t-1}$, summarized in a predicted estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$, and the actual observation $y_t$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t|t}$; 
prediction: the filter computes the estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ of the state $x_{t+1}$ by considering the first equation of the model $(18)$. Such estimate $\hat{x}_{t+1|t}$ is characterized by the covariance $P_{t+1|t}$. 


the Kalman filter algorithm is the following
$$\boxed{\begin{align} 
\text{FOR}\quad &amp;t=1,2,3,\dots :\\
&amp;e_t \triangleq y_t - C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1} \\
&amp;S_t \triangleq  C_t P_{t|t-1}C_t'+R_t \\
&amp;L_t \triangleq  P_{t|t-1}C_t' S_t ^{-1} \\
&amp;\text{1) correction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t|t} \triangleq \hat{x}_{t|t-1}+L_t e_t \\
&amp;P_{t|t} \triangleq (I-L_t C_t)P_{t|t-1}(I-L_t C_t)'+L_t R_t L_t'\\
&amp;\text{2) prediction}\\
&amp;\hat{x}_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t \hat{x}_{t|t}\\
&amp;P_{t+1|t} \triangleq A_t P_{t|t}A_t'+ Q_t
\end{align}}\tag{21}$$
note: if $x_0$, $w_t$, $v_\tau$, are gaussians and incorrelated for all the possible choices of $t, \tau$ then at every time istant $t$ the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$ is by definition the MMSE estimate of the state $x_t$, so the Kalman Filter finds the optimal estimation of the state $x_t$.

note: the signal $e_t$ is called innovation and it is the prediction error of the output of the system $(18)$ (since the predicted output generated by the Kalman filter is $\hat{y}_{t|t-1}=C_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1}$). Here the matrix $S_t$ is the covariance of the innovation (and not the number of susceptibles at time $t$, I hope that it is clear from the context when I'm talking about the innovation covariance or the number of susceptibles). The matrix $L_t$ is called correction gain since it is used to define the corrected estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t}$. The matrix $I$ is an identity matrix $n \times n$.

note: the initialization is $\hat{x}_{1|0}\triangleq \hat{x}_0$, $P_{1|0} \triangleq P_0$.



1.3 application to the SIRD estimation problem: static estimation

Before to jump in to the more general problem that involves the model $(17)$, I want to use the Kalman filter to make a more simpler ""static"" estimation of the parameters.
In order to use the Kalman filter, the idea is to define the following non-linear, time-variant, static system
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=x_t+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{22}$$
where 
$$x_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_t  \\ 
    \beta_t  \\  
    \gamma_t \\  
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
y_t \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    S_t  \\ 
    I_t  \\  
    R_t \\  
    D_t 
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
h_t(x_t) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t-1}-\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t-1}-{I}_{t-1}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t-1}{I}_{t-1}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t-1}+{I}_{t-1}\gamma_t 
\end{bmatrix} \\ \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{23}
$$
the system $(22)$ is not linear, so the idea to deal with this problem is to consider a simple linearization around the estimate $\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$of the output equation (like in an extended Kalman filter). 
$$y_t \approx h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+\frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}(x_t-\hat{x}_{t|t-1})+v_t \tag{24}$$
by defining the new coordinates
$$\tilde{y}_t \triangleq y_t-h_t(\hat{x}_{t|t-1}) \qquad \tilde{x}_t \triangleq x_t -\hat{x}_{t|t-1} \tag{25}$$
and the time-variant matrix
$$C_t \triangleq \frac{\partial h_t}{\partial x_t}\Bigg|_{x_t=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}}=\begin{bmatrix}
    -\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\ 
    \phantom{-}\frac{\hat{S}_{t-1}\hat{I}_{t-1}}{N} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; -\hat{I}_{t-1}  \\  
    0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1} &amp; 0\\  
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; \phantom{-}\hat{I}_{t-1}
\end{bmatrix} \tag{26}$$
the system $(22)$ is approximated by the linear system
$$\begin{cases}\tilde{x}_{t+1} &amp;=\tilde{x}_t+w_t \\
\tilde{y}_t &amp;=C_t \tilde{x}_t+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{27}$$
at this point it is possible to apply the Kalman filter $(21)$ to get an estimation for the parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.



1.4 application to the SIRD estimation problem: dynamic estimation

In order to take into account the time dependency of the parameters it is sufficient to modify the first equation of the system $(22)$ in a suitable way that reflects approximately the real dynamic of the parameters
$$\begin{cases}x_{t+1} &amp;=f_t(x_t)+w_t \\
y_t &amp;=h_t(x_t)+v_t\end{cases}\qquad \text{for} \,\, t=0,1,2,\dots \tag{28}$$
in other words, the dynamic of the parameters $\alpha_t, \beta_t,\gamma_t$ is described by the motion model $f_t(x_t)$. To get an estimate of theese parameters it is possible to use an extended Kalman filter like in the previous section 1.3. 



2 My Questions

Before to writing down some code to get experimental responses, I'd like to have some suggestions about the previous dissertation. I have also two questions.


I'm not sure that $C_t$ is well defined. Let's assume that his definition $(26)$ is correct. Since the prediction model is $(14)$, that is a dynamic model, the quantities $\hat{S}_{t-1}$ and $\hat{I}_{t-1}$ are functions of all the previous predictions $\hat{y}_0 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}),\hat{y}_1 (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}), \dots, \hat{y}_{t-2} (\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1})$. This means that at every time step the computational burden to get $C_t$ increase because it requires the simulation with the actual parameter $\theta=\hat{x}_{t|t-1}$ of the system $(12)$ up to time $t-2$ (that is increasing). It is possible to define a more efficient recursive formula to define $C_t$?
How can we define a reasonable motion model $f_t(x_t)$ that can take into account the observations made by Sextus Empiricus in the reply in my first thread?

",459081,"Nice write-up. I think eq#23 is not quite correct though. The observation $y_t$ should be a function of the state $x_t$ and noise $v_t$, like you said in eq#22 $y_t = h(x_t) + v_t$.

The issue with eq#23 is that $y_t$ depends on $y_{t-1}$. This would break the Markov assumption that $x_t$ is a sufficient state, which is foundational to the Kalman filter formulation.

I think the correct approach is to use
$$
x_t := \begin{bmatrix} S_t \\ I_t \\ R_t \\ D_t \\ \alpha_t \\ \beta_t \\ \gamma_t \end{bmatrix}
$$

This would be considered ""augmenting the state"" (SIRD) with the parameters ($\alpha$,$\beta$,$\gamma$) to do a ""joint-state-parameter"" estimation.

Your dynamic would be
$$
x_{t+1} =\begin{bmatrix}
    {S}_{t}-\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\alpha_t \\ 
    {I}_{t}-{I}_{t}\beta_t-{I}_t\gamma_t+\frac{{S}_{t}{I}_{t}}{N}\alpha_t  \\  
    {R}_{t}+{I}_{t}\beta_t \\  
    {D}_{t}+{I}_{t}\gamma_t \\ f_\alpha(x_t)\\f_\beta(x_t) \\ f_\gamma(x_t)
\end{bmatrix} + w_t
$$

You can treat the SIRD part of the dynamic as deterministic if you so desire by setting its entries of the covariance $Q_t$of $w_t$ to $0$, though that places all the uncertainty on the initial condition and parameters, which I don't think accurately reflects reality - the SIRD model isn't perfect even with best-fit parameters.

Your observation model would be the actual data, which we'd consider to be measurements of the SIRD part of the state, corrupted by noise (which you can remove by making its covariance $R_t \approx 0$ if you think the SIRD records are perfect).
$$
y_t = \begin{bmatrix} S_t \\ I_t \\ R_t \\ D_t \end{bmatrix} + v_t
$$

As for what you should design for $f_\alpha(x_t)$ and the other parameter dynamics, I think a random walk is fine (i.e. $f_\alpha(x_t) = \alpha_t$ so all the movement is due to the $\alpha$-component of $w_t$). But really I think designing a more sophisticated structure for that is a matter of studying epidemiology more. By creating a structured dynamic for the parameters, you are essentially making a more detailed model than what SIRD alone captures. Such an advanced design should probably be rooted in hard science, else it just becomes excess model capacity ripe for overfitting / poor generalization.

In other words, if you want a model for how the parameters would move, you should come up with an explanation / mechanism for why they would move. What do these parameters mean - what dynamical factors would influence them?

By the way, the selection of the noise covariances is pretty critical to the usefulness of the Kalman filter. If you are using them as tuning knobs rather than estimating them from data, you might as well just go back to your second approach (nonlinear regression of a multi-step predictor) and just use Gauss-Newton's method instead of gradient descent for optimization. The extended Kalman filter is essentially a covariance-weighted recursive application of Gauss-Newton least-squares.

",Accepted,"It sounds like you're trying to apply the intuitions of a hard-margin SVM to the results of a soft-margin SVM and being led astray by the differences.

I can tell you're using a soft-margin SVM because you provided a ""cost=10"" parameter; the e1071 R library does not appear to support a hard-margin classifier directly, but you can approximate it by using a suitably huge cost parameter, say 1e10.

When the cost is low, a soft-margin SVM will sometimes choose to misclassify one or more points if it means it can get a wider margin. Perhaps surprisingly, they may do this even when the data are truly linear separable and a ""perfect"" solution could be found. If you increase the cost to 100 or 1,000 it will behave more like the hard-margin version and you will see it correctly classify all training examples.

8702,446785,An appropriate likelihood for reporting disease,"Wuhan flu is a very hot topic right now, and I have seen at least two papers and several bloggers attempt to model the $\mathcal{R}_0$ of the disease using the reported data on wikipedia.

The problem I have is that most of these approaches use a Guassian likelihood to get point estimates, and while that may be a good approximation, the uncertainty estimates would be more than wrong.  Consider for a moment that if there are $x$ reported cases of the flu then there can be more cases we have not seen, but not fewer.  The likelihood for any model should respect this property (that our observations can under estimate the true prevalence of the disease at a given time, but can not over estimate it).

What would be an appropriate likelihood for this process?  I imagine it would almost look like a flipped pareto distirbution. Interested in hearing your thoughts.
",446856,"Too early to fit models with $R_0$ (with only data about the number of infected people).

The larger problem is that the development is still in the exponential phase and we can not model the decrease of the exponential growth rate. See also this question: Fitting SIR model with 2019-nCoV data doesn&#39;t conververge In that framework (SIR model) the only variable that can be accurately determined is $\beta - \gamma$ but $R_0 = \beta/\gamma$ is still difficult to determine (but it seems to be $\beta-\gamma \approx 0.4 &gt; 0$ thus we at least know that $R_0&gt;1$).

See also the comment at the end of that answer about the use of only a time series in the number of infected people. That number does not provide a good measure of $R_0$, but it is auxiliary information that is being used. For instance direct estimates of $\gamma$ the parameter relating to how long people remain infectious (by observing how the virus has spread, rather than just using the quantitative numbers).



regarding your problem/question

Binomial distribution

One might model the reported cases as a binomial distributed variable. The observed/reported cases will be some fraction $p$ of the underlying real cases (in more advanced models this fraction could be variable depending on time and the number of cases). But the current data do not allow to study this (potentially one can fill in the gaps based on studies on a wider set of epidemical data). 

Given such situation (a binomial distributed fraction) one would expect that the variance is related to the mean by a factor between 0 and 1 (binomial distribution has $\mu = np$ and $var = npq$). However when we plot an exponential curve to the data then we currently get RSS being a factor 4 larger than the sum of means. Thus there is posibly overdispersion instead of underdispersion (although it is not yet a good accurate measure*).

*With so little data we can not be sure. In addition the model is not so great (as you say the approaches use simple Gaussian likelihood). One might use some correlation in the errors. I imagine that this is a potential source of overdispersion.

Poisson distribution for increments

There is new/recent an R package available on github that aims to model this specific epidemic:

https://rdrr.io/github/chrism0dwk/wuhan/

This model models an ODE according to a SEIR model and uses data that is separated for individual regions (combining this wit hthe population size in those regions and the transport in between those regions). 

The predictions from the model are compared with the observations by comparing the increments and assuming that these increments are Poisson distributed. 



Is there enough data?

The exponential model in the above graph does not fit accurately the data (although I would say the exponential fit is sufficient, still one might desire some more complex fit to learn more). One could make the fits more complex, possibly the factors that determine the dynamics are not constant in time. 

But, one may wonder what could be achieved by making the model more complex. I do not see what could be achieved. The data shows a reasonable exponential curve, and I do not believe that we should try to squeeze more out of the present data.

Potentially, one could incorporate more background information, and then some sort of simulations**, and a more Bayesian approach, could be interesting in order to project into the future what we could see (but this will lean mostly on prior information and those 12 data points do not provide a lot of information).

**Those simulations would also help to handle the correlations mentioned in the previous footnote.

Some interesting view of the data might be the distribution of the increases in the infections from day to day. This increase is not constant in time. We might better regard it as a variable with a random distribution by itself (and model variation in growth curves based on this random variation in the growth rate). Models to use are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion (the likelihood computation by Chris Jewell is also treating the evolution as a random walk by evaluating the observed 'step sizes/ increments')

Scaling the data could improve the conditioning of the problem. See: In Machine learning, how does normalization help in convergence of gradient descent?
Training a neural network is hard in general; maybe a different configuration of hyperparameters (especially learning rate) would allow gradient descent to succeed. See: What should I do when my neural network doesn&#39;t learn?
Gradient descent isn't a very good optimizer; LM is way better. And we should hope that LM is better, because it's doing more work to find a good direction! So in this sense, it's not surprising that gradient descent doesn't do a great job compared to LM.

Here's a fun comparison of SGD and LM on a very simple problem:


  I bet a lot of you have tried training a deep net of your own from scratch and walked away feeling bad about yourself because you couldn’t get it to perform.
  
  I don’t think it’s your fault. I think it’s gradient descent’s fault. I’m going to run gradient descent on the simplest deep net you can imagine, a two layer deep net with linear activations and where the labels are a badly-conditioned linear function of the input.
  $$
\min_{W_1,W_2} \mathbb{E}_x \left\|W_1 W_2 x - Ax \right\|^2
$$





  Here, the condition number of $A$ is 1020. Gradient descent makes great progress early on, then spends the rest of the time making almost no progress at all. You might think this it’s hit a local minimum. It hasn’t. The gradients aren’t decaying to 0. You might say it’s hitting a statistical noise floor of the dataset. That’s not it either. I can compute the expectation of the loss and minimize it directly with gradient descent. Same thing happens. Gradient descent just slows down the closer it gets to a good answer. If you’ve ever trained Inception on ImageNet, you’ll know that gradient descent gets through this regime in a few hours, and takes days to crawl through this regime.
  
  The black line is what a better descent direction would do. This is Levenberg-Marquardt.
  
  If you haven’t tried optimizing this problem with gradient descent, please spend 10 minutes coding this up or try out this Jupyter notebook. This is the algorithm we use as our workhorse, and it fails on a completely benign non-contrived problem. You might say “this is a toy problem, gradient descent fits large models well.” First, everyone who raised their hands a minute ago would say otherwise. Secondly, this is how we build knowledge, we apply our tools to simple problems we can analyze, and work our way up in complexity. We seem to have just jumped our way up.

8715,446912,Is there a model to predict mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic?,"Following the recent Coronavirus outbreak, various mortality rates have been published.

Most of these are simply the ratio between the deaths and the total verified cases, which is not a very accurate indicator as many of the verified cases are ongoing and could result in deaths.

I know some statistics from university but I am in no way an expert. I was wondering if there was any commonly used statistical model to predict with some accuracy the mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic. If there is, I'm guessing some of the variables would be the time between the onsetting of symptoms and death/healing for resolved cases.
",446923,"A natural (and perhaps naive) way to model mortality would be a binomial model, i.e.,

$$
x \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p)
$$

Here $x$ is the number of deaths, $n$ is the total number of people infected, and $p$ is the mortality rate, or the probability of dying given that you have the disease. 
When we say something is distributed according to a binomial distribution, we mean that the observed counts $x$ are the result of $n$ independent trials, each with probability of ""success"" (in this case, death) $p$. These are usually termed ""Bernoulli trials"".

We can now examine the likelihood of $p$ given $x$ and $n$ -- i.e., how likely it would be to see the data we have observed, given different values of $p$. Imagine we had 100 cases, 50 of which resulted in deaths:

n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- 50
s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Binomial likelihood""
)




This shows that a point estimate (the maximum likelihood estimate) would be 0.5, which of course makes sense. Something important to consider here is the amount of data we have observed. Since we have a good amount of observations, the likelihood is fairly narrow. This means that there is a relatively small range of values for $p$ for which the data we observed would be likely to occur.

Now, imagine if we had only 10 cases, 5 of which resulted in deaths:

x &lt;- 5
n &lt;- 10
s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbinom(x, size = n, prob = s), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Binomial likelihood""
)




When we don't have much information, the likelihood is quite broad, indicating that the data would be fairly likely for a wide range of values for $p$.

It can be helpful in cases like this to incorporate a prior, or how likely we think different parameter values are, based on our existing knowledge. For example, imagine that we knew that the distribution of mortality rates across all known human diseases looked something like this:

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, 32, 64), type=""l"",
  xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Proportion of diseases""
)




This is a Beta prior with $\alpha=32$ and $\beta=64$, i.e.,
$ p \sim \text{Beta}(32, 64)$.
We might want to use this prior information to guide our inferences about the mortality rate of a new disease for which we have very little information. We can combine this prior information with the likelihoods we've already plotted. If you want details about how this is done, one great starting point is this blog by David Robinson. Basically, the posterior distribution over our parameters is a Beta distribution. For parameters we take the $\alpha$ of our prior and add $x$, and take the $\beta$ of our prior and add $n-x$.

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- 50
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x), 
  type=""l"", xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Posterior density""
)




As you can see, this prior information ""pulls"" our estimates downwards towards the distribution of existing mortality rates. However, if we had strong enough evidence (for example, thousands of infections and deaths) we could still produce an estimate outside of where the prior distribution is concentrated. When we have a small amount of data, a prior can be particularly helpful to avoid results that are purely the result of sampling noise - for example, imagine the first 10 people with a disease happen to die, and the next 90 survive. The estimate after 10 people would be 100%, which is extremely unlikely, given what we've seen about human disease in the past.

s &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=1000)
n &lt;- 10
x &lt;- 5
plot(
  s, dbeta(s, shape1 = 32 + x, shape2 = 64 + n - x),
  type=""l"", xlab = ""Mortality rate (p)"", ylab = ""Posterior density""
)




When we have very little data, this prior information really shrinks our estimates towards what we believe is a reasonable estimate of mortality, given what we've observed in the past about other diseases.

You can continually update this posterior distribution as new data comes in  by adding deaths to the $\alpha$ parameter and survivals to the $\beta$ parameter of the Beta distribution.

This is all just general; I have no real expertise in disease modelling. None of the parameters values I've chosen have any basis in reality.
",Reasonable,"Your requirements are not restrictive enough to determine some cases. For example, for these values:

f = [0,110,200,300,0]
g = [0, 13, 6, 9, 0]
h = [1, 3, 6, 9, 1]


how would you wish sim(d,f) and sim(e,g) to compare? What about sim(h,b) - would a Minkowski distance with p != 1 be any good for you? How about negative p?

However, you can try to construct a combined parametrised metric that satisfies your desired properties. You've already identified cosine similarity, manhattan similarity and normalisation to be useful. I'll give you an example in python, because it is as good as any language (or pseudolanguage) and it determines functions that otherwise might have more than one possible definition.

The basic principle is that one could use the metrics that have the desired properties, parametrise them, and finally weight them to achieve the desired balance. They need to be in the same domain, and because of cosine similarity I will bring all metrics in the [0,1] domain.

I'm not employing normalisation, because I don't see how it could add value to discern the given values. This might change, depending on other relationships you might wish to provide.

So an initial take could be this:

from math import atan, pi
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine, cityblock

a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
b = [0, 3, 6, 9, 0]
c = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
d = [0, 100, 200, 300, 0]
e = [0, 110, 210, 310, 0]

coef1 = 100

def man_derived(a, b):
    return (2 / pi) * atan(cityblock(a, b))

def bespoke_sim(a, b, p1):
    return (1 - cosine(a, b)) * (1 - man_derived(a, b))**p1

print(""sim(d,e)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(d,e,coef1))
print(""sim(a,b)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,b,coef1))
print(""sim(a,c)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,c,coef1))
print(""sim(a,d)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,d,coef1))
print(""sim(a,e)=%.5f""%bespoke_sim(a,e,coef1))


This results in:

sim(d,e)=0.88270
sim(a,b)=0.99565
sim(a,c)=0.71714
sim(a,d)=0.10168
sim(a,e)=0.09702


This gives you a desired order of the other elements, except for sim(d,e), but as I already indicated, I am not sure what logic should lead this to be larger then sim(a,e).

In general I hope you can see the thinking: Metrics are combined by multiplication, because this keeps them in the [0,1] domain. Parameters (in the example this is p2)are used to weight individual metrics by rising them to a higher multiplicative power.

Also, you didn't want to limit your domain, but obviously one event has different implications when one of few, and when one of many. Then what is many - 100, 1 million, more? In my formula this comes into play with the atan function.

8858,448320,Coronavirus growth rate and its possibly spurious resemblance to vapor pressure model,"I collected the latest data on the coronavirus from Johns Hopkins University as shown and fitted different curves to this data to model the relationship between the number of confirmed patients $P$ who are/were infected as function of time $T$ taking 20-Jan-20 as day 1.





As opposed to applying the standard SIR and SEIR I tried out simple curve fitting to see the general trend. The curve fitting software I used has well known models form different branches of science as well as we could build our own custom models which I did as shown in the image below. The score against the name of a model gives how well a model fits this data. The higher the score, the better the fit and the maximum possible score is 1000. Although we have data only for 18 days (as of 7-Feb 2 AM GMT) one model always kept appearing at top as the best fit and this was the vapor pressure model. After checking for various boundary conditions, I rejected many of models but I could not find any immediately reason to reject the vapor pressure model. Similarly when I modeled the number of reported deaths against time, the vapor pressure model once again gave the best fit which for which I could not find any obvious reasons to reject.



So I did some research on the vapor pressure model.

Basic concept of vapor pressure Because the molecules of a liquid $L$ are in constant motion and possess kinetic energies, at any moment some fraction of them has enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid to enter the gas phase. This process, called evaporation, generates a vapor pressure $P_L$ above the liquid. Molecules in the gas phase can collide with the liquid surface and reenter the liquid via condensation. Eventually, a steady state is reached in which the number of molecules evaporating and condensing per unit time is the same, and the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Under these conditions, a liquid exhibits a characteristic equilibrium vapor pressure that depends only on the temperature $T_L$. Volatile liquids are liquids with high vapor pressures, which tend to evaporate readily from an open container; nonvolatile liquids have low vapor pressures. When the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, bubbles of vapor form within the liquid, and it boils. We can express the nonlinear relationship between vapor pressure and temperature as an almost linear relationship using the Antoine equation. 

$$
P_L = exp\Big(a + \frac{b}{T_L} + c\log T_L\Big)
$$

Next I did some research what is known about how the coronavirus spreads and if it is related to liquids. Here is what I found. 


  How coronavirus spreads: When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they shed droplets of saliva, mucus, or other bodily fluids. If any of those droplets fall on you—or if you touch them and then, say, touch your face—you can become infected as well. Hospital for communicable diseases define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person for 10 minutes or longer. Time and distance matters.


The coronavirus spreads when it escapes from an infected person through microscopic droplets of liquid carrying the virus through air. I wonder this has anything to do with why the vapor pressure model keeps coming on the top as the best fit even though there is no apparent pressure or temperature as in the vapor pressure equation and I cannot see how they could be elated. May be all this just a mere coincidence. 


  As a bad scientist but a concerned human, I thought I must report this
  observation in case there is anything worth in it.


Question: Given this limited data what can we infer about the corona virus growth rate and how can we reject the vapor pressure model as a mere spurious correlation.

Note 1: I am well aware of spurious correlation. But with only 3 weeks of data, we many not be able to detect a different trend this early. Hence I am reporting the best fit regardless.
",448325,"""If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."" The dataset you have is small, possibly underrepresented, and of unknown quality, since it is argued that many cases could have not been diagnosed. You observe an exponential growth, a common phenomena in many natural and artificial processes. The curve fits well, but  I'd bet that other similar curves would also fit well.

Notice that the the Antoine equation mentioned by you, is a very flexible one, since it can account for constant ($\alpha$), exponential ($b/T_L$), and linear ($c\log T_L$) growth curves. This makes it easy to fit to many datasets.

Moreover, with this kind of data, it may be harder to model it at early stages. Notice that you could fit a linear growth model to the earliest period. Later, quadratic may fit just fine. Later, exponential would fit better, where the exact rate may be hard to catch, since by definition ""the more it grows, then the more it grows"", and it may easy speed up quite rapidly. It may be easy to fit some curve to such data, but the best test of it, would be a test of time, i.e. validating it on future data.

9451,453791,"How could one (tentatively) estimate the actual number of COVID-19 infections in an area, using hard data like age-adjusted death rate?","A big problem with the current COVID-19 epidemic is the difficulty of getting tested (due to mild symptoms and lack of testing kits). This makes it impossible for patients with little or no symptoms to know how likely it is to be infected and further spreading the disease. 

There are estimations available but only take into account confirmed cases (and range between 10x-1000x of this number). How could one get estimations of the number of patients by using secondary features of the distribution that could be more robust? Age-adjusted death rate under intensive care could be one of several such parameters.


",453878,"Death rate

Using death rate may work when people that die have most likely acquired the virus locally. 

However, for the moment, many people die because they acquired the virus during a visit to another area, or because they got it from another person that acquired the virus abroad. 

Thus this death-rate based number is not very accurate unless the virus has fully spread out (in which case it will be more likely to get infected from a local source). 

For the cases of Wuhan, Italy and other epi-centers, which have more spread due to local infections rather than foreign infections, death rate might be a good probe (although you still have to deal with the delay).

In addition, while death rate might be more thrustworthy than total cases of infection (just think about the Germans, with lots of supplies, are testing with a lot of thousands people, while neighboring countries, with limited supplies, are trying to limit the use of testing as much as possible), bit it is still a biased number. It is not easy to determine/pinpoint the cause of death. Often multitude of diseases are present. If a person with cancer or aids gets a pneumonia from nCoV-19, then what is the cause? The sampling of 'cause of death' is not very clear and becomes part of the analysis.

Statistics are only usefull for a comparison when they have a similar underlying basis. 

Travel data

The virus is mostly spreading out irregularly over a network. It spreads out differently at different scales, within the household, neighborhood, workplaces/schools, villages, agglomerations, countries, continents.  You can sort of see the virus spread around with sudden jumps from large node/community to large node/community. 

You can use occurrence of the virus in those nodes/communities as the variable (so you do not count individuals, since we do not know the presence in all individuals, but instead count the much better known presence of the virus in communities), and then use a model for the dynamics of the virus spreading between this different nodes in the network.

For instance. E.g. in region A you encounter x cases of disease among people that came from region B and y cases of disease among people that came from region C, while the travel to those regions is $r$ and $q$, then an estimate of the relative presence of the virus in regions B:C can be approximated by (x/r):(y/q).

I remember there was an early article on the spread of COVID-19 (I believe it was by Chinese scholars) that tried to estimate $R_0$ and included information about the frequency of travel between different regions.



Random tests

You can perform test on a sample from the population that does not show any symptoms and use the prevalence of the virus among this sample to make an estimate about the prevalence in the entire population.

If the prevalence is very small then this requires a very large sample which might be difficult. In that case one may perform the test among a sample where the suspicion of the prevalence is higher and gain some information about how many people have the virus in that group. Such a measure can be used to calibrate the estimates based on incomplete information (ie. along with other information, such as the rate at which people with the virus have the particular mild or severe symptoms, you get an idea about how much the current estimates are underestimating the true number of cases).
",Reasonable,"I think this might be how to think of it :

9456,453879,How to correctly analyze fatality rate and daily deaths of Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreak?,"This is a strange case of difference in fatality rate between Chinese and Italian covid-19 outbreak.

In my knowledge, fatality rate is a ratio between deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of subjects diagnosed with the disease.

Starting from this assumption, I attempted to analyze difference in fatality rate between Chinese/Italian outbreak. Herein, I propose a reproducible R example for exploring this variable:

From this basis, I'm a little bit confused about such difference in terms of fatality rate between the two analyzed countries. In fact, China has the maximum fatality rate at 4%, while Italy at more than 6%. For this reason I've two questions:

1) Is my computation correct?

2) If yes, why such a huge difference in terms of fatality rate? 



EDT II

I would like to improve this question reporting a recent Science paper which can partially explain these differences. In fact, Li et al reported that for each COVID+ patient, other 5-10 are undocumented COVID+ leading to missleading fatality rate. Moreover, as reported in the comments, to date, there are no univocal diagnostic methods wordwide.
However, Italy is experiencing a huge increment in daily cumulative deaths compered to China:

Something is happening there! Hubei province is almost similar to Italy in terms of surface and population but very different in terms of population mean age since Italy is one of the oldest EU country.
",453882,"Reason 1 something technical about the computation.

Dying occurs with some delay to getting sick. As a consequence the ratio of people that got sick and the people that have died, is not equal to the ratio of people that will die.

(Still, if the number of sick cases and death cases both grow exponentially with the same factor then you might still expect this number to remain constant, but keep in mind that the growth is not exponential and that it is only a simplified model)



Reason 2 something important about the data acquisition

You might say, ok then let's compare the number of death cases with the number of sick several days ago (according to the average number that it takes between getting sick and dying).

But, the most important reason why the death rate based on these statistics is not constant and not comparible is because those numbers are only the reported cases and those may be a lot less than the real cases. So you are not computing a real death rate.

The statistic (reported/confirmed cases) is not what you think that it is (number of cases). This is especially clear in the curve of cases for China which has a bump because the number of cases rapidly increased after the defenitions were changed (from positively tested people to people with clinical symptoms)
",Reasonable,"Note in your wikipedia definition of case fatality rate, you NEED to know the eventual outcome of all individuals infected with disease. As they note, of the 100, 9 die, and 91 recover, they do not live with infection. Your data do not show the number who recovered from disease. If the lag between confirmed case and death is long, you underestimated CFR. CFR can also be biased by the number of unconfirmed cases who die from disease and are confirmed as cases based on cause of death.

Questions I understand that if the logistic model had been good, the next point should have been in the confidence range with a probability of 90% (or 95%). Can I conclude that the logistic model is not a good model here? Are there some standard procedures to assess the validity of the prediction by taking into account the uncertainty on the model?

Also, the difference between the two asymptotes gives me an indication of the precision of the prediction (it is not off by 1 or by 10^5 but by about 500 deaths). Is there some classic methods to take this into account?

Edit 21/03/2020: clarification in response to hakan's answer

The model I fitted is 
$$\dfrac{c}{1 + a e^{-b x}}$$
and with $a=514434$, $b=-0.276$ and $c=5568$. Of course, this model is the same as @hakanc's, with a different parametrization (e.g. his $K$ corresponds to my $c$). The corresponding covariance matrix is
$$\begin{bmatrix} 1.1\times 10^{10}&amp; 641 &amp; -2.5\times 10^7 \\ \star &amp; 3.8\times 10^{-5} &amp; -1.6\\ \star &amp; \star &amp; 80\times 10^3 \end{bmatrix}$$

I believe the low sensitivity to $c$ ($=K$) is described by the $(3,3)$ component of the covariance matrix, $\sigma=\sqrt{80\times 10^3}\approx 280$. So though I understand (and agree with) the argument of low sensitivity, I believe it is already included in the ""confidence band"".
",454917,"When working with mathematical models, it is always good to check the assumptions of the model. The logistic function is often used when modelling population growth, and specifically where the rate of reproduction is proportional to both the existing population and the amount of available resources, all else being equal. Letting $P$ represent population size, the differential equation is 

$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {dP}{dt}}=rP\cdot \left(1-{\frac {P}{K}}\right),}
$$
where the constant $r$ defines the growth rate and $K$ is the carrying capacity, see the link for more details. The solution, letting $P_0$ be the initial population, is
$$
P(t)={\frac {KP_{0}e^{rt}}{K+P_{0}\left(e^{rt}-1\right)}}
$$
Thus, this model would be appropriate if Italy did nothing to mitigate the spread of the virus, but they are in fact using quarantine. The effect of wrong modelling assumptions would be that if you cross-validated the fitted model, you would get poor results. 

Additionally, since the shape of the logistic function is 



and in your data, it does not seem to include the part where the curve flattens out, I would suspect that the parameter describing that phenomenon, $K$, would have a high variance from your estimation procedure. An intuitive explanation for this can be done by plotting the function for different $K$ and constant $r$:



In this figure, if there is only data for $t$ between 0 and 1 would not reveal so much information on $K$, other than if $K$ is around 10, compared to $K &gt; 100$. More formally, assuming you are doing maximum likelihood estimation, you can look at the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the corresponding likelihood function, to see if optimization problem is well conditioned. 
",Reasonable,"It is generally inappropriate to leave out the components of an interaction term in a regression.

At the very least you should include a plain ""temperature"" term in your model.  Whichever dummy variable you leave out is your reference category.  So b2 should be the effect of temperature in February relative to January.  But without the uninteracted temperature term, your model does not allow temperature to have any effect in January.

9584,455129,Trying to Estimate Disease Prevalence from Fragmentary Test Results,"In response to the spread of COVID-19 disease, all Californians were ordered on 19 March 2020 to stay at home, except for such necessary errands as trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, etc. On 21 March the San Francisco Chronicle reported that about $11\,500$ tests for the virus have been completed so far with $1206$ positive results among them. 

Can anything useful be said about the prevalence of the virus in California based on these results? If (a) the 11500 tests were from randomly chosen Californians and (b) the tests were of ""gold standard"" quality, then prevalence would be close to $1206/11500 =  0.1049 \approx 10.5\%.$

However, according to the Chronicle article, guidelines have centered on testing people showing symptoms of COVID-19 disease, care workers who have had contact with COVID-19 patients, and people who have symptoms of pneumonia, but test negative for pneumonia. Moreover, tests are ""coming from a growing list of private companies, private labs, and public and private universities,"" so there is no way to know proportions of false positives and false negatives for any one test, let alone the overall rates for whatever mix of tests accounts for the 11,500 reported results.

In my answer below, I will extend my answer to this question to give prevalence values resulting from various assumptions about the sensitivity and specificity of the tests involved. I use the notation of that page. This analysis may help to answer the question for whatever population produced the specimens tested.

Additional answers are welcome, perhaps showing alternative methods or based on
additional information that may become available as the pandemic
continues
",455133,"Notation. Let $\pi = P(\text{Disease})$ be the prevalence of the disease in the population and $\tau = P(\text{Pos Test})$ be the proportion testing positive. For the test, let
$\eta = P(\text{Pos}|\text{Disease})$ be the sensitivity and
$\theta = P(\text{Neg}|\text{No Disease})$ be its specificity. Also, given test results, let 
$\gamma =  P(\text{Disease}| \text{Pos})$ and 
$\delta =  P(\text{No Disease}| \text{Neg})$ be, respectively, the predictive powers of a positive or negative test.

If a test is of gold standard quality with $\eta = \theta = 1,$ then $\pi = \tau.$ Tests that accurately sequence the genome of the virus may be gold standard tests. Often the first tests for a virus may have considerably lower values of $\eta$ and $\theta.$ It is difficult to find accounts of values of $\eta$ and $\theta$ for any of the tests in current use for COVID-19. (According to one unauthorized report, a test used in China had $\theta \approx 0.7.)$

Traditional estimate. First, we look at results for tests with $\eta = \theta = 0.95.$ Then for data with $n= 11\,500; a = 1206,$ we have $\hat \tau = t = 0.1049.$ The associated 95% Wald confidence interval for $\tau$ is $(0.0993, 0.1105)$
from which one can derive the confidence interval
$(0.0547, 0.0672)$ for $\pi.$ Also, $\pi = 0.061$ implies that the predictive power of a positive test is $\gamma = 0.5523.$ Only about half of the subjects testing positive are actually infected.
Some computations in R follow:

ETA = THETA = .95
n = 11500;  a = 1206;  p0m = -1:1; t = a/n
wald.TAU = t +p0m*1.96*sqrt(t*(1-t)/n);  wald.TAU

GAMMA = PI*ETA/(PI*ETA + (1-PI)*(1-THETA)); GAMMA
[1] 0.5522849


When the traditional estimate is problematic. For a poorer test with $\eta = \theta = 0.90,$ this method gives a CI for $\pi$ 
as $(-0.0009, 0.0131),$ which has a (nonsensical) negative left endpoint. (We would expect about 1150 false positive tests even with no infected subjects. This is getting close to the the observed number 1206 of positive tests.) In such circumstances, one wonders whether to trust the point estimates $\hat \pi = 0.0061$ and $\hat \gamma = 0.0522.$

ETA = THETA = .9

A Gibbs sampler. One useful alternative approach is to assume a beta prior distribution on prevalence $\pi \sim \mathsf{Beta(\alpha, \beta)}.$ Even if noninformative with $\alpha = \beta = 0.5,$ such a prior distribution excludes value of $\pi$ outside $(0,1).$
Then we use a Gibbs sampler to find the posterior distribution of $\pi,$ given our data $n = 11\,500, a = 1206.$ Its steps, within each iteration, are as follows:


We begin with an arbitrary value of $\pi_1 \in (0,1)$ and use it to estimate 'latent' counts of subjects with the disease based on predictive values $\gamma$ and $\delta.$ We sample counts $X \sim \mathsf{Binom}(a, \gamma)$ and $Y \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n-A, 1 - \delta).$
Then with the estimated $S = X+Y$ infected subjects, we update the beta prior at this step as $\pi|S \sim \mathsf{BETA}(\alpha + S, \beta + n - S).$ Finally, we sample $\pi_2$ from this updated distribution. Even with arbitrary $\pi_1,$ this new value $\pi_2$ is likely to be closer to the truth.


Simulated posterior distribution. Iterating through many such steps we get successive values $\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_3, \dots ,$
in a convergent Markov chain, for which the limiting distribution is the desired posterior distribution of the prevalence. To make sure that the chain has reached steady state, we
use only the last half of the many values $\pi_i$ generated in this way. 

Cutting 2.5% of the probability from each tail of the simulated posterior distribution, we can obtain a 95% Bayesian probability estimate for prevalence $\pi.$

Because the two-sided Bayesian probability interval $(.00003, .0123)$ has its lower endpoint so near to 0, we also look at the one-sided interval $(0, .0110)$ for $\pi.$  

Because we estimate the predictive power $\gamma$ of a positive test at each step of the chain, we capture its values in order to get a 95\% Bayesian probability interval $(0.0003, 0.1005)$ for the predictive power $\gamma$ of a positive test. If we were to sequester subjects that get a positive result with this test, then only a relatively small proportion of sequestered subjects would actually be infected.

Diagnostic Plots. Not all Gibbs samplers converge as
anticipated. Diagnostic plots show that this one does. 


A plot of successive values of $\pi$ shows the nature of the convergence of the Markov chain. The history plot of $\pi$ shows that the chain 'mixes well'; that is, it moves freely among appropriate values. There are no points of
near-absorption. 
The trace of running averages of the $\pi_i$ shows smooth convergence to prevalence 0.0049.
Vertical blue lines indicate the burn-in period.
The ACF plot shows that the $\pi_i$ are not independent. Among the $m = 100\,000$ values, perhaps there are 1000
independent ones. In many Gibbs samplers, Markov dependence 'wears away' more rapidly than here. 
The plot at lower-right is a history plot of the $\gamma_i.$ 




Variations. If we run the same program with $\eta = \theta = .95,$ results are nearly the same as for the traditional procedure. If we have useful prior information (or opinions) about the prevalence, we can incorporate that information into the prior distribution on $\pi.$

With replace=T you tell the model to sample with replacement. So in this case it will sample 10 units from class 0 with replacement.

9675,457408,Can stats regarding the Coronavirus outbreak tell us anything at all?,"Everywhere in the news we hear about numbers of corona-virus infections, deaths and recoveries.

In lots of the publications the numbers (especially the infections) are compared with previous days. Mostly the presented numbers are 'growth' of new infections in per cent and the total number of infections so far. Then the numbers of different countries are shown. 

I tried to get something out of these numbers (of infections) and realized that some important information is not told: the amount of tests done. And even further, who is tested? Which criteria? And this varies a lot between countries. Then there is the accuracy of tests. 

The number and kind of tests done everyday change as well as more capacity is created or less capacity is available due to overloads or work restrictions.

I told myself the amount of deaths, as horrible as it sounds, is a good indicator of stabilization or regression. But no, people are not effected the same way regarding their previous medical condition. At some point in time, people at risk will ""disappear"" (again sorry for the word-choice).

",457428,"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good

Many of the issues you have raised are perfectly reasonable concerns.  Having said that, it is important to distinguish between cases where reported data is wrong, versus cases where reported data is correct, but is limited in its usage due to the omission of other relevant information.  The latter case is really quite ubiquitous in statistical analysis, since it is very rare that we have all the data we would ideally like to have.  In such circumstances, it is also important not to make the perfect the enemy of the good by presuming that the absence of a comprehensive dataset on every variable we would like to know about precludes any reasonable inferences being made from the data we have.

The main comprehensive public dataset we have available for the COVID-19 virus is the data held and updated by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre at John Hopkins University.  This is the repository of data that is being used for the vast majority of media reports and data visualisations on the spread of COVID-19.  The database has data on confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths, plus GIS data on where these occurred.  The data is sourced from the WHO and various national health departments, and it is being updated frequently.

It is certainly true that there are a lot of other things we would ideally like to have data about, to assist in understanding the path and severity of the virus.  As you have suggested, it would be wonderful if we could also obtaina comprehensive dataset on all the tests that have actually been conducted (including the negative results), and the characteristics of all the affected patients, including their age, sex, and health factors.   At this early stage it is probably overly ambitious to expect all of this data to have been collected and collated, but hopefully the various health departments of the world will eventually be able to bring some of this data together.  Health departments cannot legally disclose health information on particular patients in a way that would make them identifiable, so it is an extremely complex task to collate this type of data if the goal is to make it available for public analysis.  No doubt there will be some efforts to obtain and collate more detailed data, but it will be a difficult task.

When interpreting limited data, it is desirable to describe that data in a way that makes it clear how it was collected, and this collection mechanism forms a caveat on analysis.  Thus, we can refer to the reported numbers of infections, recoveries, deaths, etc., from each of the reporting countries, while noting that there may be disparities from these figures to the actual true numbers.  Most health departments around the world are set up so that they can obtain these figures with reasonable accuracy, so that large diparities between reported figures and the true values are unlikely, except in the case of countries that make a deliberate effort to suppress this information.  Notwithstanding the lack of the ideal data you would like, from the reported data there are certainly some things that we can reasonably infer.  For most countries, the data is likely to be a reasonably representation of the number of infected, recovered, and dead patients out of those who have been properly tested.  (Of course, I take some of the data, such as the recent numbers from China, with a large degree of scepticism.)  It is also likely that there are other infected and recovered people who have not been tested, and who therefore do not form part of the reported statistics.  Even so, this data gives us a pretty good look at growth rates for the infection in various cities and countries around the world, which allows us to see where the virus has progresssed most rapidly, and where it has been relatively contained.  These numbers also allow some attempt at extrapolation, which allows health authorities to make predictions on the likely number of cases at future dates, and the health burden this will create in different places.

Your question appears to assert that most of these trends are likely to be ""wrong"" due to the absence of data on other factors such as total testing and patient health.  In my view, that is not the correct way to look at it.  Rather, the reported trends may be correct, in the limited descriptive sense, but there may still be underlying non-reported factors that would give reason to anticipate future changes in those trends.  Personally, I am extremely impressed at how rapidly these various organisations have coordinated a large data collation and made public online platforms reporting on the infection and updating it frequently.  I can log on every day and see updated graphical information showing the progression of the infection in virtually any city or country in the world!  The data may not be perfect, but I would think it would bear enough of a resemblance to reality to be valuable information.  I think the effort is quite amazing, and it far past what we could do even ten years ago.

Point forecasting stock returns is notoriously difficult, so I would not expect much success with that regardless of what model you choose.

Later, I learned it in statistic literature where there are log odds and bunch of probabilistic interpretations. 

Today I am reviewing some differential equation literature, and found the logistic function is a solution for the following system:

$y'=y(1-y)$, and $y(0)=0.5$.



So, my question is more like a ""chicken and egg"" problem: where does the logistic function come from? Do we first have the function or the ODE?
",459180,"I read from Strogatz's book that it was originated from modeling the human populations by Verhulst in 1838. Assume the population size is $N(t)$, then the per capita growth rate is $\dot N(t)/N(t)$. By assuming the per capita growth rate descreases linearly with the population size, we can have the logistic equation of following form:
$$\dot N(t)=rN(1-\frac{N}{K}),$$
where $K$ is carrying capacity of the environment. From the equation, we can see that when $N$ is very small, the population grows approximately exponentially. As $N$ grows until half of the capacity, the derivative $\dot N$ is still increasing but slows down. Once $N$ passes the half line, the derivative decreases so we can see a bending curve (we can see this actually from Coronavirus cases) and the population asymptotically approaches the capacity. Up to this point, we observe the properties of a logistic function. Intuitively, when $N$ is larger the capacity, the population decreases. By further mathematical simplification of the equation, we have an equation like this:
$$\frac{df(x)}{dx}=f(x)(1-f(x)),$$
which has analytical solotion as:
$$f(x)=\frac{e^x}{e^x + C}.$$
With $C=1$ we have the logistic function.

However, it sounds like you want to say that, since you have such a tight estimate of the standard deviation when you have many observations, you can say that you have the population parameter pinned down.

Well...even then, you don't actually know the population variance. Howeer, the t-test takes care of this internally. As you increase the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution by having a larger and larger sample size, the t-distribution converges to N(0,1). For a large sample size when you almost know the population variance, you're almost doing the z-test.

  It's counterintuitive, but the smaller the sample size of a clinical test, the more significant its results are. The differences in a sample of 20 people may be more significant than in a sample of 10,000 people. If we need such a sample, there is a risk of being wrong. With 10,000 people, when the differences are small, sometimes they don't exist. 


Is this a false statement in statistics? If so, is it therefore also false in the Biomedical field? On which basis can we refute it properly, by a confidence interval?

Dr. Raoult promotes Hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19, thanks to an article about a study on 24 patients. His claims have been repeated a lot because of for this study, but mainly in the mainstream media, not in the scientific press.

In machine learning, the SciKit workflow states that before choosing any model, you NEED a dataset with at least 50 samples, whether it be for a simple regression, or the most advance clustering technique, etc., which is why I find this statement really intriguing.



EDIT: some of the answers below make the assumption of no result bias. They deal with the concept of power and effect size.
However it seems there is a bias in Dr. Raoult data. The most striking being removing data for the dead, for the reason they could not provide data for the entire duration of the study.

",459587,"I agree with many of the other answers here but think the statement is even worse than they make it out to be. 

The statement is an explicit version of an implicit claim in many shoddy analyses of small datasets. These hint that because they have found a significant result in a small sample, their claimed result must be real and important because it is 'harder' to find a significant effect in a small sample. This belief is simply wrong, because random error in small samples means that any result is less trustworthy, whether the effect size is large or small. Large and significant effects are therefore more likely to be of the incorrect magnitude and more importantly, they can be in the wrong direction. Andrew Gelman refers to these usefully as 'Type S' errors (estimates whose sign is wrong) as opposed to 'Type M' errors (estimates whose magnitude is wrong). Combine this with the file-drawer effect (small, non-significant results go unpublished, while large, significant ones are published) and you are most of the way to the replication crisis and a lot of wasted time, effort and money. 

Thanks to @Adrian below for digging up a figure from Gelman that illustrates this point well: 



This may seem to be an extreme example but the point is entirely relevant to the argument made by Raoult. 
",Reasonable,"Yes, a smaller sample CAN be more informative due to the confluence of similar significant discriminating attributes. For example, a small sample of Detriot African Americans with similar income levels and associated access to healthcare, occupations, stress, diets and pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure,...) is better than a 100,000 sample of Americans where the confluence of these attributes is rare.

This is a problem in model design and conformity of the data to underlying assumptions of independence and identically distributed.

This is an issue other conferences throughout history have surely had to deal with, so I wanted to ask StackExchange if there were any best practices around for dealing with an issue like this. Some questions:


How far out should the go/no go decision be made? If the conference is late April, should we be planning to let participants and speakers know by early April so they can cancel flights and so on?
What criteria should best inform whether we cancel or not? Number of cases in the participants' states for instance?
In the event we are to cancel the conference, how can we still give the speakers a chance to advertise their results? Have there been successful ""video conferences"" before where the organizers collect video for each talk and then upload them and participants can make comments? 

",145100,"Regarding remote conferences, these have been successful. Often the motivating factor has been mitigating climate impact. For example, Yale Climate Connections wrote an article giving advice for running virtual conferences. Author Sara Peach presents three kinds of virtual conferencing, all of which have been done successfully: 


remote presentations in a traditional conference format. If people choose to not travel, they can still remote in or follow the session on social media. (Example: AGU)
hub-based conference, where people gather in regional clusters. Each hub has some of its own content but are able to watch each other's presentations. (Example: International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition)
an entirely remote conference, where people record and upload videos of presentations and conferencegoers have weeks to ask questions and interact. (Example: A Nearly Carbon-Neutral Conference Model)


I'll add that an entirely virtual synchronous conference has also been done successfully. One example is NACADA, the Global Community for Academic Advising, which ran a 24-hour live-streaming virtual conference. 

The mixed-conference or hub models may or may not be feasible, since they would still involve people gathering in some models, and you aren't sure yet whether that will be feasible on any scale. Also, developing regional hubs would take time you don't have.  Thus, if you decide to go entirely virtual, a synchronous-with-live-streaming conference and a asynchronous recorded approach have been done, and the resources linked should provide a way to start researching or planning that model. I also advise contacting your own IT department about the possibility. 
",Accepted,"It is possible that there are some academic programs. They would be more likely at a Community College, I think. But you might be able to obtain an internship or apprenticeship at some custom publisher or even a major book publisher. 

To find such an opportunity I'd suggest the following steps. Your local library has a need to re-bind books and knows who does that. Find out the contact information for such a service and, starting with them, work up the chain of contacts to the people who do the actual production. 

Other than librarians, you could also talk to a book-rep who visits your school or at an academic conference. Again, work up the chain of contacts to the production department. 

There are a number of presses in the US who do custom small editions for authors and others. Thorndike Press in Maine used to be one of those, but I don't know if they still do it. But there are others. Search for Custom Publishing. But they may use suppliers of services and you will need to work to find who actually does the work. You are looking for, and may find, a company that actually uses hand crafting to bind books and even those that design the bindings using non-standard materials. 

If you can find a really high quality book production outfit, you might explore either an internship or an apprenticeship with one of them. It might be paid or not. But even an entry level regular position will give you an opportunity to learn the skills. 

Another source, but harder to find, are individual artisans who design and manufacture their own books (poetry, art, ...). I met one within the past year at a craft fair. But a search for ""hand made books"" might turn up something.

3287,145370,Tips for transition to online classrooms given university shutdowns in response to COVID-19,"Given the recent shutdowns of many universities across the world, there's an increased interest in online education techniques.

In my case, I am a TA for a quantum chemistry class, and I'm finding it daunting to transition to online teaching. At first, I got really excited because I thought of taking advantage of this situation to run a flipped discussion section: I'd record lectures in advance, and then have virtual office hours where students could Zoom/Skype/Google hangout with me and we discuss in the same chatroom (so everyone hears the conversation). 

However, in what I suspect to be an attempt to distance themselves from something nice and free/far cheaper (like edX) which has been doing this online routine for a long time, my university has required that we livestream our lectures/discussion sections. This is purportedly to be in the aim to make their online experience as college-like as possible, but it's problematic for multiple reasons. First, lectures are at 9AM EST... Do we expect students to tune in at 10 PM in Japan? Or 3 AM in Hawaii? 

Second, we should use the silver linings present in this university shutdown: video lectures = students get to go back and re-listen to a part that confused them! From my perspective, this university requirement goes against an attempt to maintain normalcy: normalcy should not be defined as continuation of the same daily routine (impossible for many), but rather a continuation of helpful instruction.

I intend to find out whom to email about this, but in the meantime, what resources/advice would you suggest for an instructor who suddenly has to transition to the digital classroom?
",145371,"This is marked for community ownership so constructive edits will be welcomed. It is, however, more directed at those who can design a course, rather than a TA who has limited control. 

Background

Many of the teaching techniques we use are not optimal for learning. They have been designed for economic efficiency since they scale. Some of them have been a bit obsolete since the creation of the internet. But face to face classes in real time are no longer necessary. Lecture is efficient (one teacher, many students, synchronous), but again, not optimal. Testing is a poor way to guarantee competence. This current emergency can be considered to be an opportunity to rethink everything we do toward finding better ways to educate people. We are forced to act and the old ways don't work in a new environment. We should be looking for new ways. 

The essentials of teaching are Delivery, Practice, Feedback, Assessment. All of these require Two Way Communication. They don't require synchronicity or exams. The first job is to teach people, not to grade them. If you get that part backwards then you are only ""teaching"" people who don't need to be taught. 

Every student is different. Nearly every student learns differently from the way their instructor does. The instructor has been proven to stand out in a particular system in which others have failed. As an instructor you have an obligation to every student willing to put in the effort, not just to the ones naturally predisposed to ""win"" in some system. Not every student starts at the same place with the same understandings. The same words don't necessarily have the same meanings to different people. 

Some people have handicaps that prevent certain kinds of interactions. Hearing impairment and vision impairment are obvious ones, but there are others. 

Learning is individual, but the process need not require isolation. It can be a communal process with learners helping each other. Denying students the option of working together is sub-optimal. A course can be a communal activity, not a hierarchical one. 

Some students will succeed no matter the system. They don't really need you for anything more than pointing to important sources/ideas. But most actually require your assistance since insight into a topic can be hard to come by. Many students actually need to be taught how to learn. If you change the system of learning they may need to be retaught how to internalize ideas and turn them into competencies. It isn't automatic or obvious. 

Learning isn't ""consuming"" material. It requires active participation. It requires a change in the brain (The Art of Changing the Brain by James E Zull)

All of these things have long been taken into account in designing educational systems, but the current practice is a compromise that values economic (scale) values over educational ones. Not everywhere, of course, but the exceptions seem few to me. 

Let's assume that everything is on the table, except that students and instructors can no longer meet face to face in groups. Meetings of any kind need to be small and optional with alternatives provided. Computer communication of some kind is needed, but costs are an issue as is the privacy of all participants. 

What to do, what to do. 

Ideas for Delivery

There are a lot of ways for students to have access to the material of a course. Books are traditional. Lecture has replaced most other methods. But lectures are longer than they need to be. Some research I read suggests that lectures of 10 to 15 minutes are more efficient than hour or longer lectures (https://spokenimpact.com/what-is-the-ideal-length-for-a-presentation/). Those contemplating video should take note of that. Video also needs to be accompanied with a transcript to aid those with impairments. 

Moreover, students need to be able to review material. Video is difficult in this regard since it is hard to quickly return to a small part that needs review without watching longer sections, which leads to boredom. Transcripts can mark the time that important ideas are introduced. 

There is a fine line between having good and poor production values in video. If they are too good, a video talk becomes just entertainment with poor learning, unless other means are used to encourage/enforce engagement. If they are too bad, then students will get lost and frustrated. Video professionals are good at this sort of thing, but it is hard to bootstrap immediately at scale.

Delivery alone is just media. Students need to incorporate what they see in a lecture, long or short, into their long term memory and into their effective competencies. More is involved than the eyes and ears. Students often think that the will automatically ""learn"" what is presented to them in a lecture, talk, demonstration, etc. but it is anything but automatic. 

Caveats: Any ""solution"" that requires real-time synchronous presence on the internet will probably fail. And it will fail invisibly for some. Connections are dropped, servers overload, etc. It is hard enough to keep students off their phone when in a class. It is probably impossible to do in a real-time internet lecture. Other distractions will intrude. Moreover, unless you have an exceptional communication system, students won't be able to interrupt you when you make a mistake, as you will. No questions are likely to be asked in real time. It is also difficult for a presenter to give a lively talk with no audience feedback at all. Especially if you are trying to do this under emergency conditions without training and experience.  

But if you absolutely must use synchronous delivery you need to do two additional things. The first is that you need to record and post your lectures so that those who must miss the original don't lose access. 

The second, just as vital, is that you provide a real time feedback to yourself (or to an assistant sitting by your side) so that questions can be asked as you lecture and so that students have a way to mention/note errors you make. 

And make sure that students know what to do in the case that you lose the server and the ability to broadcast. Avoid chaos and uncertainty as much as possible. 

Ideas for Practice

Student practice exercises and tasks may not need to change much. Students, depending on the field, need to write, solve problems, and other things as appropriate. For the most part this can probably proceed largely unchanged. Instructors have access to many such student exercises. If the students have a text book they probably have a bank of suitable exercises and questions. 

And note that practice and reinforcement is probably the most important element in a delivered education. The ""content"" that a student needs is, for the most part, available to them. There are exceptions for very advanced work, but the world's knowledge is pretty much available. Instructors help students choose the important things and avoid the garbage, of course, but it is up to the students themselves to learn by reinforcement (combined with feedback). Whatever the topic, competence comes from repetition and reinforcement. The only thing I teach nowadays is Tai Chi. We have a saying that you need to repeat a movement ten thousand times to learn it. Somewhere in those ten thousand tries, insight will start to develop. The same is true in things like mathematics and writing poetry. 

So, remember that the things that you make the students do to learn are much more important than the things you say. Good course design focuses on the student tasks, not the lectures. 

I caution, however, that copyright considerations may apply if an instructor tries to utilize exercises from copyrighted material. They are, in a sense, publishing things they send to students in an online course. Caution and legal advice is useful. 

Ideas for Feedback

Feedback is two way. You need feedback from the students on your presentations and assignments. Students need feedback on their own work. A number or letter grade on a paper isn't feedback. It gives no basis for understanding how to improve. 

If the materials presented are well vetted, such as textbooks, the need for feedback to the instructor is a bit lessened. But videos, especially those prepared in the moment are likely to contain errors. Shorter videos are easier to fix than longer ones. But, unlike face to face classes, the instructor isn't likely to be interrupted when there is a misstatement or an omission. Moreover, you need some indication that the students have actually understood what you have been saying and presenting. Again, in fact to face classes you can look at expressions on their faces for some important feedback. 

Lets assume for the moment that you have already taught your students the importance of taking notes during presentations. At the end of a lecture you can ask individual students, perhaps volunteers, to tell you an important idea from the talk. You can do this two or three times and give them feedback on their replies. This can be transferred to online learning. If readings or video presentations are short (and, I assume asynchronous) you can ask students to send you a summary of the lesson. Restrict them to one or two sentences. Another possible request is to ask them to send you a possible exam question on that material. At some point, all student replies, perhaps anonymized, can be made available to everyone. By glancing through the replies you learn whether they are getting the main points and they are also getting the reinforcement they need. 

Giving feedback to students on their work is critical to learning. This involves answering questions that they have, but also showing them where they are making mistakes, and why, in their own work. The previous section talked about repetition and reinforcement. It is possible for students to learn and reinforce the wrong message. If you get an incorrect idea deeply ingrained in your mind it can be difficult to dislodge. All student work needs to be commented on, not just graded. Publishing solutions to exercises after the fact can help, but it isn't the same thing. 

This idea of individual feedback is one of the most difficult things to arrange in the modern educational system, simply because of scale. My university teaching (and student life) mostly involved classes of fewer than 30 students. At that scale, I could easily give good individual feedback on weekly assignments. At 40 students I found I needed help. Massive courses have a problem here that requires tools - probably better tools than are now available. I'll note that Harvard's CS50 course is delivered to about 800 students at a time. But the staff for the course is about 40 individuals, so the ratio is about 20:1. Some of the staff are graders who comment on student work. Others are TAs who hold individual ""recitation"" sections of 20-30 students so that questions can be answered and misconceptions dispelled. I worry that moving such recitation online might not work as well at scale unless there are communication tools that let people learn from the questions of others. Many students are reluctant to ask questions. The brave students willing to do so actually contribute to the education of their peers. But, answering a question for a single student, say in an office, is much less productive than answering it in public, so that all can share the response. Tools are needed for this, though they can be pretty simple. University managed email lists subscribed to by students and staff are pretty effective. 

But if students produce ""papers"" of any kind, those need to be annotated and returned. More than a numeric or letter grade is needed. Something as simple as pointing a student to a place they need to review is helpful. But the goal is to foster insight. PDF files can be annotated and returned, but the process is awkward at best. And, again, there is the scale problem. It takes time to review and time to annotate. Then, the student will likely have questions that need to be addressed based on the annotations. The increase in awkwardness using current tools may require more staffing to make things work effectively. Even a simple email to a student takes more time than jotting a comment on a paper and then returning it at the next face session. 

Ideas for Assessment

In my view, evaluation and assessment are the most difficult issues we face in moving to an internet model. However, they also, again in my view, have the most potential for long term improvements in student learning, provided that we take the opportunity to learn how to do a better job of it. 

The first principle of assessment ought to be that any sort of evaluation have an actual educational purpose, not just a ""sorting"" purpose. I think that many of us aren't doing a stellar job of this, having opted for easy solutions that scale, rather than solutions that aid student learning. Multiple choice tests are overused and while it is possible to design good ones, it is devilishly difficult. Things that rely on machine grading in general are too likely to also rely on only shallow learning and memorization, rather than deep learning and mastery. If the students can be held in a room and closely monitored this sort of thing tells you something about them, but it can likely be better. Move them outside your purview and it becomes nearly impossible. And it even fails at scale. 

While you can do some technological things to lock up a student's personal computer they are intrusive but also ineffective. You can enlist a vast army of TAs to monitor student webcams (intrusive, again) but even there, what happens slightly off screen is invisible. Without such intrusive measures students have access to helpers both human and electronic. Closed-book, closed notes exams are probably a mistake in any case, but online they are difficult to impossible to monitor. There are too many inducements for students to break the rules to really assure validity. Honor codes, such as those of Dartmouth College do have a positive effect, but part of that effect is that the codes have been in place for half a century. 

I have some personal suggestions about alternatives to examinations and, especially, high stakes examinations such as finals that account for a large fraction of a students grade. I don't claim these are the only solutions, but am more interested in sparking thoughts about how we can do a better - more learning focused - job of evaluation and assessment. I implemented these more and more as my career progressed and I learned more about students and about learning. 

The first idea is to reduce the overall effect of any given exam or test. If you have forty small items you can get at least as good a picture of a student's progress as if you have only one or two large ones. Moreover, high stakes testing too often leads to poor student studying habits, such as cramming for exams and cheating. 

One technique I used toward the end was ""cumulative grading"". A course had 1000 points assigned to it and different student activities were ""worth"" a certain amount of points. A project might be 100 points. The result was evaluated (and commented on) and a certain number of points was awarded, perhaps 80. I also published the minimum number of points necessary for each letter grade, say 800 for a B. When a student accumulates enough points to ""earn"" the grade they desire they no longer need to do more. There was no risk. Another feature of it was that if the student wasn't satisfied with the points earned they could re-do the work and possibly earn additional points. Some limits were put in place, but they were generous. The philosophy behind it is ""You aren't in this course to prove to me that you don't need to be here."" But note that I could do this since the ratio of staff to students was good. This is hard to scale without help. 

The second main technique I used and can recommend is to make almost all assessment and evaluation based on student writings and projects, not examinations. And, if the nature of the course permits, use group projects primarily. For my courses the group size was usually between two and five. These groups can meet in cyberspace or, if location and other factors permit, they can meet face to face. The projects might be large or small. They can be graded once or often. Points can accumulate. It is the project that is graded, not the individuals, so everyone earns the same grade unless that is impossible. Peer evaluation is used to award bonus points or to solve issues of non-participation, etc. 

If there are a number of group projects students can move between groups if needed. But students also need to be taught how to run an effective group project. In the courses I taught, dividing up the work ""equally"" was always discouraged and if done, usually leads to poor outcomes. Students need to form teams, not just amalgamations of individuals. In CS this skill will be valued later in their careers. 

Also, peer evaluation has to be properly managed. Students don't ""grade"" one another. They comment on the contributions of a few or all of their team mates. ""Who was the most helpful team member? (or three top members) Why? What did they contribute? What was your own chief contribution?"" 

At a certain scale or with sufficient help you can easily determine who falls into which important grading groups. Who is excellent in all respects? Who shows promise? Who is getting by? Who is deficient? Who has failed? Elaborate point systems in which an 85 is somehow significantly different from an 87 have little real meaning in my opinion. 

To emphasize a point above. In many fields, even very technical ones, writing is an important skill. Writing essays on a given topic is good professional preparation for a budding mathematician. Exams can be replaced with such essays, lessening the needs for security and such. They seem to me to be much more value long term than skill at exams. But you can probably expect that students will hate it initially. 

The above, of course, are just ideas. But I found them to be more aligned with the teaching mission than the more traditional lecture and test. 

Ideas for Communication

To handle all of the above with online courses the main need is for effective communication between faculty and students and, I found, between students themselves. One goal is that what any student sees can be seen by any other student. 

Communication tools need not be complex or comprehensive. But they should permit asynchronous communication and should permit many-way communication. Threaded email lists are very useful and don't require extensive facilities. They can be private lists, managed by the university alleviating some privacy issues, open to only class members and staff. Documents can be distributed. Questions can be asked. Questions can be answered at any time of the day or night - even by other students. Someone needs to monitor these to make sure that misinformation is quickly corrected and that any rules about posting or not posting certain content are maintained. 

If project groups are long lived, then each group can have its own mailing list and can also use other tools they find for communication. 

Another useful tool is a group chatroom. Group chats can be held periodically, though the email lists were more useful for discussing course material. These are necessarily synchronous and so not every student might be able to ""attend"". But it is easy to capture the complete conversation as a text file and send it to everyone or post it on a course web site. 



My own expertise in this comes from helping to design and deliver a graduate program in which students met face to face only once a month for half a day per course. All work was done in groups (of about 5). Face time was only used for things that could not be done on line. We used simple tools for communication. All student-professor communication (other than personal things) was open to all students. Students could ask questions at any time and other students were encouraged to answer from their own expertise. The course was always live, every hour, every day. Questions got answered quickly, if not always perfectly. Students didn't get stuck. The goal was to build a learning community. That community has persisted past graduation. 



Minor updates only anticipated.

",Accepted,"“Grading on a curve” means that you select what percentage of grades you want to correspond to a given final grade. It’s entirely up to you how you choose the resulting mean grade using that system. If you want to make the mean a 60 or an 80 or anything else, that’s your call. Ultimately, though, the point of the curve is to avoid having “grades less than 50 are failing.”

""History"" shows the history of the manuscript from submission till today, such as when it was submitted, when an editor was assigned, when each reviewer was invited, and so on. Every time the system sends an email, it's logged here.
""Edit submission"" lets the editor modify the submission (e.g. if the authors later discovered they've not included a source file, this is where to add it).
""Invite reviewers"" - self-explanatory. Clicking this goes to another menu that lets the editor both mine the current database and / or register new reviewers to invite. If this submission had a completed review there'd be a ""view reviews and comments"" button, and if it's ready for a decision, there'd be a ""submit editor's decision and comments"" button as well. 
""Set final disposition"" terminates the peer-review process. For this manuscript, since no decision has been made yet, the only option is 'withdraw'. If a decision has already been made (accept / reject), this is also where to set the final status.


The other boxes should hopefully be self-explanatory.

Clicking the ""more"" button lets the editor see who those reviewers are, when the reviews are due, how long it's been since the reviewer invitation was sent out (for the reviewer who hasn't responded), and the reasons for declining, if any. 

The bottom manuscript is showing status ""required reviews completed"" because the settings for this particular journal is set to flag any submission with 1 completed review as such. Some journals might require two or more reviews before the status updates.

3346,145494,What methods can be used in online exams to genuinely test the students' knowledge and capabilities?,"There has been a lot of talk about online teaching in relation to covid-19 and campus shutdowns.

This question isn't about that though: my question is about what ways online examinations should be treated in counterpoint to written examinations. 

I'm going to be transferring my course's written examination into an online environment. This examination involved 2 hours of students, with a pen and paper, answering questions both short and long in a typical examination environemnt.

An online exam however cannot be policed. Demanding it be anything other than open book is unrealistic. What methods can be deployed such that it is a genuine test of students' knowledge and capabilities?
",145495,"First, a two hour time limit might be difficult to enforce or to guarantee, especially if it uses a real-time clock. At some level of scale you may start to find that some students didn't get the exam paper or were unable to return it by the deadline. So, I'd start by rethinking if a time limit of less than a day is really essential to your exam. 

Second, you can pre-vet any questions you ask by doing searching yourself online for possible answers and responses. Reject questions that have too much online presence, or be prepared for getting that back as answers. Presumably the test isn't about effective online searches. 

Third, give up the idea of asking students for facts. That is obvious, I'd think, as facts are cheap. But even facts requiring computation, such as in mathematics or statistics can be generated with tools such as MatLab or Mathematica. 

The best sort of questions, I think, are those that require either or both of interpretation and insight. Questions about the why of things rather than the what and how are much better. However, these are the hardest to create, the hardest to answer, and are likely to have the widest variation in quality from students. To grade them might require quite a lot of interpretation: does this student show any insight at all into the subject? Pass-fail grading can be considered. Repeat attempts can be considered. 

As an alternative to an exam, you can consider individual portfolio development by students. Students write or otherwise create some artifacts according to some criteria. Plagiarism concerns come in to play here, of course. 

I'll note that honor codes can help to a certain extent, though provide no guarantees. And honor codes created in the moment are probably less effective than those of long standing. 
",Accepted,"I believe what you're talking about is the issue of tuition waivers: that is, are students obligated to pay fees for the tuition, or are those handled by the university.

In many countries in central Europe (including Scandinavia, Benelux, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria) PhD studies are actually paid employee positions, so what tuition charges exist are small, since students normally don't have to take many courses as part of the PhD program (international students may need to register for a few classes to satisfy qualification requirements, but it's not a coursework requirement per se). In other locales, such as as some programs in the US, grants cover tuition charges as well as stipends, preventing students from having to pay those charges. And in many of those countries, the tuition fees amount only to a few hundred euros, not tens of thousands.

It's only where students are expected to do large amounts of coursework and where no arrangements to remit or waive tuition are made that students are responsible for paying large amounts of tuition.

However, even if the number of monthly arXiv submissions is to be considered a good proxy, it will likely lag by more time than we have seen so far. Yes, closures, adapting to online classes, and changed schedules will delay new experiments and other activities.

Would it be appropriate to thank my local government in the acknowledgements?  If I'm honest with myself, I don't think I would have been able to do this with such focus and efficiency if all other aspects of my life hadn't been suddenly shut down.

  When this is all over, and most of your readers will probably know multiple people who died during the crisis, this would not be a good [look].


This is a global crisis that is only just beginning. By the time the dust settles, millions may have died from the virus alone. It would be a rare reader who does not personally know someone affected. More will have died because of how overwhelmed the global healthcare system is. 

Even more will be affected by the economic fallout.

Viral infections can have lifelong consequences, even if you live. 

If you're in a medical field, many of  your readers will be caregivers who were worked to the bone for months, and had to make impossible triage decisions. 

For your readers, researchers are forced to halt research, often at great expense. Many studies cannot be paused for three months and picked up at the same place. 

And you're proposing to put in your acknowledgements ""gee I got so much done while quarantined!"" This is offensive at best, and obscene at worst. We in universities are extremely lucky that our pay will most likely not be stopped, and we can just pick up and work from home. That is not happening for most of the nation.

",Accepted,"Your question is based on a few statements which I believe are misunderstanding or over-generalisations.


  Postdoc fellowships are only the external funds I (as an early-career postdoc) can secure.


A fellowship is definitely the most significant external funding a postdoc can typically secure. If you manage to get such a fellowship, you most likely will tick a ""funding"" box on your tenure-track application in most places. However, this is not the only type of funding postdocs can go for. You can bid for funds to attend conferences, you can often bid for smaller pots of money to organise workshops, conferences, and share knowledge in science fairs, exhibitions,  outreach events. You can also engage in knowledge transfer and get funding from industries or other end-users of your research. And of course you can collaborate with established professors and get your name as a Co-Investigator or sometimes second PI on the grants they submit.


  Teaching opportunity is also limited.


This is true, in principle: postdocs' main aim is to do research and they normally are not expected to teach more than 20% of load. However, although there is a time restriction, it does not limit one's ability to engage fully with various ways teaching is or can be done. If you only do marking for 20% of your time, that does not tick the ""teaching"" box so well. But if you also conduct tutorials, occasionally deliver a lecture or two, design a (part of) the assessment, contribute a bit to designing the teaching materials, it presents you much better as a well-rounded person who can be put in front of students and trusted with a course. If you also have or start work towards a recognised teaching qualification - even better.

3455,145664,Junior academic jobs in the time of COVID-19,"During these unprecedented times, it is quite hard to predict whether any recently advertised academic jobs will be still available next fall, as some countries might enforce social distancing or lockdown for a whole year. Still, many conferences are cancelled or delayed this year, thus getting papers published harder, alongside with academic path progression. I guess that we should be trying to get journal papers accepted instead...

Given that I am at the end of a fixed term assistant professor position (looking possibly forward for an open term/tenure track one), I'm asking if it will be possible that universities will still be hiring new APs when they might be asked to close until further notice (e.g, UK). Is it still possible that some degrees will convert all of their modules  into on-line classes (e.g., for Computer Science), thus allowing universities to get the same number of students they expected in the following academic year? This is still a relevant question - I think -, as the hiring of new junior accademic staff goes hand in hand with an expected increased amount of students on campus. Do you have any insight on this, or do you think that it is too early to make any possible educated guess? 

Thanks a lot for your suggestions.
",145672,"The road to the future is never smooth and upward trending. It is bumpy. In the current chaotic situation, expect chaos in the short term. Others, such as myself, have experienced career setbacks due to circumstances we can't control. I finished my doctorate at a time when the market for mathematicians was one of zero demand and massive supply. But over time, the bumps eased out for us. Perhaps, and we hope, they will for you also. But prediction of the future is an uncertain business riddled with errors among fantastic claims. 

Unfortunately too many governments around the world are behaving incompetently, making everything worse. But in the long run, climate change will probably have a bigger effect than the current pandemic. And it is also being ignored by some governments. 

However, unless we are willing to give up scientific study altogether and unless we are willing to give up educating the citizenry for the future, there is a lot of incentive to continue as we have as much as we can within the constraints that we see. Universities have many incentives to maintain their services and their structures. Most feel an obligation to faculty, students, society, and science itself. Those are strong positive forces. 

The incentives, however, need to be met with action. We don't have answers yet to some important questions. One of the questions is how meaningful and complete we can make an education without face to face interactions. Another is how we can continue some sorts of research, say lab sciences, without physical labs staffed by researchers. These are hard questions. It will take some innovation. Conferences could, in principle, move to virtual space, just as ""classroom"" education is doing now. 

Fortunately we are in a better place today than even 20 years ago with fairly ubiquitous internet communication. Some of the problems are probably solvable relatively quickly. 

But we don't know how many students will seek higher education in the next couple of years. We don't know how taxing authorities will deal with funding education in the face of economic disruption. Some, but not all, signs are positive. But uncertainty is high. Budgets, needs for faculty, working conditions, etc. All in flux. 

I suspect that the careers of people in your situation will be disrupted for a while, as mine was. But I also suspect that the situation will improve for you, though it may take some years to do so. Provided, of course, that we don't kill the planet along the way. 

Try to find a way to be healthy and happy, even if your short term goals must change. Try to use the internet to stay connected. Try to stay as productive as possible given the constraints. Apply for what positions there are, and for positions that you might not have considered if times were better.

The institute's website encourages applicants to contact the researchers directly (and does not give more information about the application process). I have been wondering whether initiating this contact over phone could be a way to make a strong first impression, and would make it less likely that my subsequent application mail will disappear in their inbox. The goal of the phone call would be to ask whether their group has an open spot for a master's student etc. On the other hand, I am worried I would be breaking some social code by making such direct contact with someone 'higher up in the hierarchy', or that they would think I am wasting their time by calling in person.

3591,147022,Should I be worried about low undergraduate grades during the COVID-19 crisis affecting grad school admission chances?,"I'm currently in my undergraduate junior year studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. I'm hoping to apply for Top 10 US grad schools in mechanical engineering in about 18 months. In response to the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis, our institution has (as have most academic institutions) switched to online teaching and made many changes to the structure of our courses to accommodate the situation.

As part of these changes, the university has offered students the option to selectively change the grade reporting on their transcripts to CR/NCR (Credit/No Credit) at the end of this semester. Normally, my grades would be pretty good (hovering around ~3.9 GPA) and I wouldn't bother to report my grades as a CR instead of as a percentage, but this crisis has completely disoriented me and made it difficult to focus on my studies.

Furthermore, the university has allowed instructors to retroactively adjust the course breakdown/weighting away from the original syllabus--this means that tests/projects that were originally worth 15% of the grade might have been increased to upwards of 40% weighting. This has had a negative impact on my course grades as well, as I was hoping to make up for poor showings on some of these lower-weight deliverables with strong final exam performances. Instead, these final exams are going to be worth much less now.

In the aftermath of these changes, I'm contemplating using the CR/NCR option on some of my course grades, particular with any grade that ends up lower than my current GPA. However, I'm worried about how this will be interpreted in my grad school admissions in a couple years. In normal circumstances, I think changing a percentage grade into a CR/Pass grade would be a red flag that a student's performance in the class was less-than-stellar.

Given the COVID-19 crisis and its effects on academia as a whole, are admissions committees two years down the road likely to be understanding if I decide to take advantage of the CR option now? Should I make use of it and explain that this was ""the coronavirus semester"" in my application package, or am I dooming myself by converting my grades from percentage into CRs?
",147026,"The situation is chaotic and it is difficult to make a prediction or give firm advice. Either path could be better than the other, depending on the judgments of others. 

However, one prediction that I can make with confidence is that universities sending out grades will also be sending out explanations that extraordinary measures were taken in extraordinary times. Furthermore those receiving grades and such will understand that the situation was chaotic and that the ordinary procedures need to be modified. 

If it were me, I'd probably opt for the grades rather than pass/fail. If necessary, I'd just explain that the general chaos affected my performance somewhat and the grades may not accurately reflect my potential. I'd suspect that letter writers would back that up. But that is partly because I'd have a history of excellent performance generally and not one that would be questioned in the absence of the current situation. (This is the hypothetical me speaking, not the real me.)

But the pass fail option can also be explained fairly easily that the risks were higher due to general disruption and you considered it the safer option as the rules were changing, making earlier assumptions invalid. 

I expect that there will be more emphasis put on interviews and on letters of recommendation for a while until things settle down again. But that is just a guess.

I'm assuming, also, that the advice you would give is non-technical. 

However, the best way to do this is to make suggestions to the author about places in the text that need improvement, rather than doing a markup. This aids the author in developing professional language skills and helps assure that you don't cross boundaries.

Not at all! It is never selfish to ask, though it might be selfish to insist, and it might likewise be selfish if you did not make it clear that you understand your advisor has the final say in this.

It is an odd feeling asking your advisor to pay for things for you, isn't it? Many students are afraid of coming across as entitled, but the better approach is to be matter-of-fact and professional about it. Simply explain (in a short message to your advisor)

In a nutshell (1 sentence), why this item would help you be more productive and comfortable working at home;

Don't phrase it as a demand; just state what you are thinking of, and then ask: ""Would it be possible to reimburse this item?""

Based on your this, I agree with the top answer that it is overwhelmingly likely your advisor will be fine with getting you these items.

feedback from your advisor
how did the term go compared to the original plan (yep, here I assume that you make the plans for your term/month/week and correct them accordingly. Hopefully, some milestones are discussed with the advisor as well)
feedback from your committee (in some universities, Ph.D. students meet with their committee regularly or send them the progress report to hear their feedback)


I would certainly not recommend comparing your progress with other students because they are different, they have different goals, and you don't have complete information about their progress either. It is very easy to get discouraged for no reason.

3678,147397,Letting grant funder know that funds no longer needed?,"I am a English PhD student (focusing on literature), but this year one of my assistantships through my university has involved some grant writing for local non-profits. Recently I've been working on a small grant for a local non-profit, which will help this non-profit pay for some consultants to help it develop a strategic plan and more effective organization. (The grant is offered by a foundation that focuses on capacity-building support for non-profits in the city where I live.) Because of the impacts of COVID-19 on the non-profit sector (i.e., many of our organization's donation funds are likely to dry up), our hired consultants have generously offered to do their work pro bono. 

Here's my question: what is the etiquette of letting a grant funder know their funds are no longer needed for a specific project? To clarify, I was pretty far into the grant writing process (original LOI / project proposal approved, directed to the next steps in the application process) when we learned we'd no longer need the funds for the consultation fees. (The foundation that has offered the funds is a major donor to local non-profits, so there is a good chance that we'll be applying to them again in the future--just for a different project.) Since I corresponded a lot with a representative of the foundation, I feel like I should follow up to let them know, especially as we may be applying to them again in the future ... what are others' thoughts on this issue?

",Accepted,"I can provide some information about the US, and maybe a bit of perspective.

First note that the process of doctoral education is quite different in the US and parts (at least) of Europe. I'll focus mostly on things such as CS and mathematics. It may be different in other fields. 

In the US, there is a relatively low bar for acceptance into a doctoral program. An undergraduate degree is all that is normally required, though some institutions may expect more. Not only that, but a four year undergrad program in the US is a generalist degree, not a specialist one. The ""major"" subject is between 1/3 and 1/2 of the total coursework and not every student is much exposed to research. 

Moreover, most doctoral students in the US in these fields are, in a sense, self funded, as they are employed by the university mostly as TAs (sometimes RAs). Universities with doctoral programs in math and CS, also normally teach a lot of undergrad students, which means either lots of small classes or larger classes with lots of TAs. There aren't normally enough regular faculty to teach all of the courses, so they depend on doctoral students to help. 

In Europe, I suspect that the bar is higher for entry, with more courses and research experience expected. I also suspect that doctoral education there is somewhat less dependent on student teachers and assistants. In some places, doctoral students are regular employees, and may, therefore, also be teachers. 

But, I think you need to expect that no matter where you are, that doctoral education is a full time endeavor. You can ""have a life"" with outside interests, but your full time ""job"" is directed toward your degree. The exception would be for someone who can do a degree part time on their own funding. These are rare. And, I think that ""full time"" normally means more than 40 hours per week. Most people make sacrifices in that way and require that other family members are willing to accept that. It isn't so much that it is demanded of you, though it might be, but that research isn't a regularized process. There is no way to say that in X course I will achieve Y results. Insight is precious. 

Whether the ""time to degree"" differs depends on how you measure it. From the end of a secondary education to a doctorate is likely about the same anywhere. There are things that need to be learned and research that needs to be done and reported. Whether you count that as part of a specialized undergraduate degree, or an MS degree, or doctoral education, matters little. Since the starting point is about the same, and the end point is about the same, there are few shortcuts. 

So, what is best for you, depends on where you currently are. If you have the prerequisites done for specialized research, then you want a program that will let you get to it. Otherwise you want something that will help you reach that point. 

I'll note, however, that, even in the US, if you are well prepared on entry, many doctoral programs will expedite your entry into research without a lot of course preliminaries. You need to pass exams and write a dissertation. You won't, most likely, be expected to repeat courses for which you are already well prepared, though you may need a way to demonstrate your competence. You will need funding, and, as an international student, few fellowships will be open to you. So you will probably be expected to teach or TA. If you are already an experienced teacher, you may have more advanced duties than most, but (student) visa restrictions can still get in the way.

As long as all of the students have the same opportunities, that seems perfectly ok - they might all learn things by doing that. The counter-argument that a student might get good at passing your exams but not good at the underlying techniques can surely only be an indictment of your exams as a measure of their abilities - a high mark in an exam should imply strong skills, or what's the point? If the issue at hand is that you might want to repeat questions from previous years in your exams (which it seems to be, given that you're talking about memorisation), maybe that's the real problem, and it might be worth thinking about just making new/more original questions? If you do that, then you can share more past papers and solutions with all of the students without causing yourself any real problems.

  Can I rightfully refuse to use the school's platform?


TL;DR: legally, probably not, but you are still more or less in the right according to the norms of academia.

Longer answer:

This isn’t so much about rights in the legal sense. The underlying context is that there is a longstanding tradition in academia that faculty own the rights to written (and other) media they create as part of their work. This is the case in the US where these rights are pretty universally respected as far as I’m aware, and in many other countries, and is true despite the fact that legally, in the US at least, employers in general can (and, outside of academia, generally do) assert ownership of all intellectual property generated by employees in a work context.

In other words, academic institutions have quite intentionally and explicitly given up some of the legal ownership rights they are in principle entitled to. As far as I understand, the guiding philosophy here is that faculty exercise a lot more freedom and control over what kind of materials they produce compared to employees in other sectors. That means the work is regarded as being of a more personal, creative nature, and it was decided long ago that that should mean that faculty would be the owners of the work. (Note: I am talking specifically about copyright; for other forms of IP like patent rights, a quite different philosophy and different policies typically apply.)

Coming back to your question: I think you are quite right to be concerned. Your university is at the very least showing itself as somewhat deaf to these very old and well-established ideas. But can you “rightfully refuse”? Legally, that’s less clear. But it would be quite reasonable to express a concern. At my university the administration has provided reassurance to faculty that their copyright over teaching materials would be respected during the COVID-19 crisis, and we were given quite specific explanations on how our rights would be balanced against the need to deliver our teaching remotely, including providing recordings, what steps we can take to prevent students from sharing our materials, and more. Perhaps by raising the issue you and your colleagues can push your own administration to also think this through a bit more.

Let me finish by encouraging you to also adopt a more flexible and tolerant mindset. All of us are called upon these days to get out of our comfort zone and appear in online videos and recordings, use online platforms with awful records on privacy, and generally engage in activities that in normal times we might consider distasteful and privacy-violating. We do this with the understanding that exceptional times call for exceptional measures, and that the highest priority right now is to keep the lights on at our institutions. As I said, I think your concern is reasonable and probably you can reach some sensible understanding with your administration about your class materials. But while you discuss the issue with them, try to keep some perspective and not make yourself too much of a pain in the butt. As important and valid as this is, people do have worse things to worry about these days.

6349,143687,Should I feel guilty for quitting postdoc due to immigration status?,"Background:
I hold citizenship of a country included in the Exchange Visitor Skill list for J1 visa holders (my research area, biological sciences, is on the list as well). My postdoc project is funded by NIH/NSF grants to the lab (not in a university). I completed a Ph.D. in a major US university last year, and my work authorization is under the F1 OPT. In light of diminishing faculty openings, I do not have a strong preference for staying in academia long term.

Details:
I started my current (and first) postdoc position a few months back, and this position is funded for the next few years. My advisor has been great, and she is supportive. I am also satisfied with the progress being made in the project. 

Due to the increased visa denials, I was advised to wait for the next visa and not leave the US during the OPT period. The HR informed me that J1 is the only option as per the organization policy, and my advisor is powerless even if she wants to help. I did not know that non-University entities could sponsor J1 and thought H1B was the only choice (a significant reason for choosing this position; my bad.) 

If I take J1, I will be subject to the two year home residency rule (which is the worst; the economy in my home country (a banana republic) is in shambles). Being on OPT would make it extremely risky to leave the US, and the status of the OPT STEM extension is uncertain. These factors make me want to look for new opportunities with H1B sponsorship. However, the fact that my advisor has been supportive and having to leave after a few months without any publication makes me feel incredibly guilty. I would appreciate perspectives on this issue.

Any reasonable person knows and understands that there are reasons which end one's participation in a project even if there is no ""outcome"" of the project.

I do not mean to be harsh -- it is only human to feel guilty about such things. What would you do if your were the supervisor?
Talk about your feelings with your friends -- emotional questions like this are better discussed with trusted people than on the Internet.

7177,145102,How to detect cheating when students take online quizzes or exams from home?,"I am currently teaching a basic R programming course with about 80 students.
Under normal circumstances,
a core course assessment component is a programming exam,
which is done in the computer lab using the lab computers.
I will arrange for the Internet to be cut off,
and we will have exam invigilators who are patrolling the exam venue
to detect or dissuade students from cheating.
At the end of the exam, the Internet is restored,
and students submit an R script (basically programming code)
using the course learning management system.

This semester, due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
the university where I work has replaced all on-campus teaching activities with online teaching for the entire semester!


With regards to teaching,
the faculty have been asked to teach our classes online using Zoom,
which gives students the freedom to take classes wherever they like.
With regards to exams,
the faculty have been asked to administer their course exams online,
with students completing the exams online from home. (What??!!)


I am very concerned about students taking exams online from home,
because I am worried that some or many of the students may use this as an opportunity to cheat on the exam —
whether it is collaborating with their classmates,
or even asking another student to take the exam in their place.

My questions:


Is there any way to detect if students are cheating (e.g., sharing answers),
when students are doing an online quiz or exam at home?
Is there a way to dissuade students from cheating?


Response to comments:


How much help do you have for these 80 students?

I do have one PhD student who is a grader.
She is supposed to spend about 6 hours a week to help with the course.

",145105,"I also teach a data and programming course, though I mainly use Python.

Is it possible for you to shift grading away from an exam and toward something else?  A project, for example?  Before going back to academia I spent years working as a policy researcher, and exam conditions simply aren't a realistic test of real-life coding abilities.  For that matter, coding with the internet turned off is also not remotely what real work looks like either.

In my class I like to give a larger project and let them have a few weeks to work on it, but I could also imagine a more simple project that they only have a few days, or even hours, to do.  Real data work often comes with time constraints, but it does not come with a lack of internet access in exam-like conditions.  Just scale the scope of the project based on how long you want them to have to work on it.

There is still a huge advantage to knowing the material, rather than having to look it up.  You can also grade on the quality of code and correctness of results, and allow for creativity with open-ended questions like ""summarize this data with two plots"".  This way each student is not only tested their knowledge of R, they're tested on their actual ability to use R in a realistic environment.

If you, unfortunately, are required to give an exam, I know there is software available for proctoring online tests.  The sort of thing that utilizes their webcams to make sure they don't leave during the test, or consult other devices, or open other web pages.  I've not used them though, so I couldn't make a recommendation.  I imagine they all require university subscriptions.
",Reasonable,"One thing not mentioned yet is that publisher policies typically have a line forbidding multiple submission. For example, Springer's publishing ethics page requires that ""The manuscript has not been submitted to more than one journal for simultaneous consideration"", whie Wiley's research integrity page says ""The Copyright Transfer Agreement, Exclusive License Agreement or the Open Access Agreement, one of which must be submitted before publication in any Wiley journal, requires signature from the corresponding author to warrant that the article [...] is not being considered for publication elsewhere in its final form.""

If you dual submit, you are violating the publisher's policies. If you are detected, there's a chance you'll be blacklisted by the publisher (not just the journal), which will close all the publisher's journals to you.

When I asked him about meeting after the corona is over, he said “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”. It seems that he does not want to meet me, which makes me feel very depressed and anxious. My only option now is to write an email. I want to talk with him over several things:

Is it possible I become his R/a? Even if my thesis is good, that is not a guarantee.
What can I do to improve PhD chance?
Will he write me a letter of recommendation?


I think that asking all of these in one email is not a good idea. So I am thinking to start it with the email:

  learn more from you.

  “don't worry about graduation, you will be able to graduate online”


In this context, I would translate your advisor's thought process as:


  This student sounds like they are anxious and worried about graduation. The best way I can help them worry less is to simply tell them not to worry.


Nothing there about wanting to meet or not. Indeed, if your advisor does not want to meet in person, it's more likely to stay out of the public and help contribute to reducing disease spread.

I think it's fine to write an email with some bullet points about things you'd like to discuss further. Thank them for reassuring you about graduation, but make it clear that there are in fact things you could use advice on besides just a path to graduating.

Then you can ask whether the professor would prefer to discuss those things over email, to meet via phone or video chat (like Skype, Google Hangouts), or to meet in person.

Be as patient as you can be, because this is likely a stressful time for everyone. Your advisor may not be able to meet or respond right away - don't let that worry you.
",Reasonable,"Preliminary remark: There are differing opinions on the important of the GRE in admissions to postgraduate programs, and its weight largely depends on the preferences of the academics making admission decisions.  Some regard the GRE general test as useful information, and take it into account, and some regard it as unimportant.  Meta-analysis of the predictive validity of the GRE can be found in Kuncel et al (2001).  Nothing in this answer should be read as implying that the GRE is determinative of entry, but if you are going to submit scores on this test, or if you are required to do this, it is good if your scores compare favourably to your cohort of applicants.



Assessing your score relative to your field of study: Assessing your score on the general GRE test can be done by comparing your score to data on the scores of test-takers, broken down by their intended graduate major.  Unsurprisingly, different fields have applicants with different levels of ability in the three sections of the GRE general test.  A score that would be considered good in some fields will be considered weak in other fields, depending on the average standard of applicants to that field.  Hence, it is important to look at your scores relative to the cohort of test-takers with your intended graduate major.

The Educational Testing Service (ETS) have published test data for test-takers (seniors and non-enrolled college graduates) who undertook the general GRE test in Financial Years 2014-17.  This data shows score outcomes for each group, based on their intended graduate major.  This data can be used as a reference to check how your score compares to other students who are intending to pursue the same graduate major as you.  It can also be used by academics to help them to interpret your score.  (ETS also produce annual 'snapshots' of score outcomes that give information on the scores across demographics and majors.)

If you would like to get a good idea of whether your GRE score compares favourably with your cohort (students seeking admission to study the same postgraduate major), the simplest thing to do is to compare your result to the published data for students in that cohort.  The data gives score frequencies in bins, so it is not usually possible to obtain your exact percentile in the cohort, but it should be possible to see roughly where you fall in that cohort.  The data also give means and standard deviations for the scores, so it is possible to obtain a standardised score relative to the cohort.



Example: In this related question the test-taker was seeking entry to an applied maths graduate program, with GRE general test scores of VR 167 (98%), QR 161 (78%) and AW 5.0 (93%).  This can be compared with histograms of scores from this cohort taken from the aforementioned data (means and standard deviations are also given in the data):



If we place the scores of this student into the data for the cohort of test-takers seeking entry to an applied mathematics graduate program we see that his quantitative reasoning score is actually below average for this cohort, despite being substantially above average relative to all test-takers.  The standardised scores for this student (standard deviations above/below the mean) relative to this cohort is VR 1.875, QR -0.500, AW 1.875.

This result shows that this particular student has a lower quantitative reasoning score than the majority of the cohort, and so this is likely to be a weakness of the application (to the extent that GRE is considered).  This is unsurprising when considering the fact that applicants for mathematics programs tend to have extremely high levels of quantitative reasoning ability.

",145248,"Absolutely. Journals are ways of disseminating scientific information, and they do take into account what is of current interest.

More specifically, however: Both Science and Nature do not just publish scientific articles, but also commentary and news stories. For example, in Science they are in the ""News"" and ""Perspectives"" parts of the magazine, and they definitely cover current events. As, if I may add, they should.
",Reasonable,"When your question bears the underlying motive/question, if it easier to publish in nature and science in the next years by doing research on this topic, then my answer would be no. There will likely be an over-proportional amount of COVID-19 related papers be published in top-tier magazines, but at the same time an enormous amount of additional funding money will flow into biomedical research institutes and create competition to solve this problem in a kind of competition, while many biometdical researchers and drug developers have already stated that the development of a remedy against COVID-19 will take 1-2 years. As Buffy commented above and I conclude, the review likely becomes and should much more rigorous for COVID-19 related papers. Additionally the submission rate and competition to get into review will rise. 

I'm aware of several retractions in nature magazine covering biomedical breakthroughs over the past years. Many retractions related to COVID-19 would not be very advertising for a journal within a reproduction crisis within academia.

I also want to mention that really important and technical papers are not only published in top-tier journals like nature and science, often the authors also choose intentionally a journal within the community to fasten the progress and reach the biggest possible dissemination. In case of COVID-19 a journal most of the researchers within a community have access to and which offers a format allowing the authors to transport the content they think is necessary to disseminate in the fastest and most completest way with short review time (which is often much longer among nature and science) to the community is probably a much better choice to save human lives.

It's a delicate question when the research question affects million of lives within a short time period, what ethically the right publishing and reviewing  behaviour should be amoung authors and journals. There are of course preprints for nature and science, but do nature and science really have the best specialists, reviewers and review system for solving a very specific scientific problem within short time or rather journals that cover since decades virus deseases? I'm at least wondering if COVID-19 will also create new ways of publishing/commenting of researchers worldwide within short-time on a very high quality level and with open-source access. 

So I'm skeptical about @Wolfgang Bangerth's answer if Nature and Science should prioritize COVID-19 papers without changing their review system/duration and if both magazines are the best place to publish such papers concerning the importance of a fast progress in R&amp;D. This depends really a lot upon how biomedical researchers share information in the fastest way via specific journals with short but rigorous review while retaining a high reproduction rate of the results.

",145347,"As already outlined in some of the comments, it is impossible to achieve what you want: You cannot control a computer to this extent without a severe invasion that would go far beyond anything that I would allow you to do on my computer due to privacy and security concerns. Unless you want to video-monitor students, you can also not prevent students from using a second computer, a virtual machine, or having somebody else working on their computer for them. And even then you need at least two cameras to see everything that the student is doing or that is happening to them and you would have to frequently check that they are working themselves, did not rig the video, etc.

On a more general level, controlling cheating on any exam that is based on limiting resources is already difficult if you do it in a setting that you can control (i.e., your room, your computers, your toilets, etc.).
By taking this battle to the “enemy’s territory” and limiting your knowledge, you can only lose.

I would thus suggest the following alternative.
This is how my programming practicals were done when I was a student.
I also successfully applied this to a programming “exam” in a course I co-organised.


The students do the programming practical with no restrictions except time.
For example, they may use the entire Internet, course material, etc.
After they submit the code, there is a short oral exam on the code.
Depending on the details of your course, you can very this exam in length and relevance, with the extreme examples being:


You grade the code and the oral exam only serves to ensure that the students didn’t cheat (and may be as short as five minutes).
You only check that the code is doing what it’s supposed to do, while the oral exam determines the grade and may also contain questions about other aspects of the course and deeper understanding.
Here, the oral exams may cost more time, but you also spend less time looking at their submissions.

If applicable, also perform plagiarism checks on the code.


Some pros and cons of this approach:


You somehow have to organise remote oral exams, but these could be just via the phone, if that suffices to establish the examinee’s identity for you. Also be prepared that this mode will amplify anxiety, language, and other issues for some students (while it reduces them for others).
You may need to modify your tasks to account for full Internet access and similar, for example it should not be anything to which a bazillion of solutions exists.
Depending on your topic, this may be very difficult.
The exam is more realistic: except for taking exams, your students will have Internet access for the rest of their career and using it properly is also a relevant skill.
The oral exam allows you to gauge actual understanding, whereas the purely written exam may be solved by rote-memorising algorithms, etc.   
In case of group work, you do not need to worry much about some incompetent student benefiting from a stronger partner.
(I am aware that this point doesn’t apply to you; I mention it only for completeness.)

Two reasons for this:
(1) It shows that you are being upfront about it and distinguishing it from talks already delivered. Some may interpret the alternative as straining too hard to show an achievement. At the same time, it underscores that you have been found worthy of nomination.

(2) It is easier to simply remove this section, should you wish to edit the CV/make a modified version for some purpose. If it is in your main list, you need to ensure that numbering and sequencing is not affected. It is quite common to have different versions of one's CV for different purposes; some are very elaborate while others focus on the major achievements only.

I was planning on graduating from high school soon and then enrolling in college.  My high school has just announced that it will be closed for a reason such as the COVID-19/coronavirus pandemic.  Will I still be able to start college?

(Question limited to students who are already admitted.)
",145398,"Ask them.
You mentioned that they accepted you already. Only they can tell you whether the admission process is affected by the recent events and whether they're willing to accomodate last minute changes to your academic schedule.
",Reasonable,"You will probably be able to start college.


Even if your high school is closed, you will probably receive a high school diploma. Schools and governments will adapt their rules to the emergency.
In many cases, you do not need a high school diploma to enroll in a college or university. For example, at Simon's Rock College, most of the students do not have high school diplomas.
After you graduate college, most employers do not care if you have a high school diploma. If you never receive one because of a disaster, you will be fine.
In some cases, the college or university may be closed at the time you wanted to start your studies. You might have to wait for it to reopen.


What happens depends on the rules of your university. Those rules might not be written yet, but this is what they will probably say.

7436,145516,Asking for status of faculty position search during coronavirus pandemic,"I applied for a faculty position and did a video interview. It was supposed that they let me know if I have been selected for campus or not.

",145521,"It’s certainly appropriate to ask. Virus or not, the world will move on from this crisis, hopefully in a timeframe of a few months, you will still need a job, and the university will still need faculty to teach classes and do research.

So yes, it’s fine to send them an email and politely inquire about the status of the search. Keep in mind that it’s possible they are scrambling to figure out how to keep instruction going and dealing with other urgent matters around the current crisis unrelated to faculty hiring. So the most likely response you’ll get is they are still figuring things out and don’t have any news.

7437,145539,How does the COVID-19 crisis affect durations of peer review and editorial handling?,"One question we often get on this site in one form or the other is: Is my paper under review (or similar) for too long and if yes, how should I react? Now, suppose I have gone through all the steps to answer this question in a normal situation: I have procured statistics of the journal’s handling or peer-review times, added a fair margin for individual variability, etc. My question is: How should I modify these in lights of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis? I do not want to bother editors more than appropriate.

The obvious thoughts are:


Some reviewers and editors are busy with challenges arising due to the crisis, e.g., due to having to switch to online teaching, having no childcare, etc.
On the other hand, some reviewers and editors now have more time available due to conferences being cancelled, not being able to access their labs, and similar.
Some fields are obviously directly affected by the crisis, in particular medicine, virology, and epidemiology. I am not considering those.


I am only interested in answers that go beyond such obvious thoughts, for example being based on experience as an editor.
The ideal are answers based on statistics, but those likely do not exist yet (but will be welcome when they eventually will).
",145542,"I am an associate editor for two journals, and although the situation is fairly new, I expect to have no substantive change in the time for me to handle papers.

The reasons for this are:


Pretty much everything is handled purely electronically anyway, so there's no physical interaction to be disrupted.
Reviewing is typically a sparse activity by people who are mostly always overloaded anyway, and it's always fairly low triage for people.  As such, I don't anticipate the availability of reviewers to particularly change: if people have more time, they'll fill it with things more important to them; if people have less time, I'll just have to ask a few more to find a full reviewer set.
The time to review is typically dominated by the time that a manuscript ages quietly on the reviewer's desk before the review deadline arrives --- actually carrying out a review often does not take all that much time, by comparison. The number of weeks we give our reviewers isn't going to change, so that dominating time won't either.
Because of the preceding factors, there's already a lot of stochasticity in time to review. Even if it does go up a bit, I doubt it will be readily detectable against the background of stochasticity.

",Reasonable,"
  How should I modify these in lights of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis?


I don't think you should modify anything about your approach. That is the journal and editor's job, not yours. Watch for official updates, if any, but otherwise proceed the same as before.


  I am only interested in answers that go beyond such obvious thoughts


This is an unprecedented situation with a large amount of uncertainty: no one has experience with it. So the hope for an answer rooted in experience or statistics seems unrealistic.

The ""obvious"" thoughts you listed are on point.
Some people will proceed the same as before, and others may have more or less time.
On average, it is unclear whether things will proceed faster or slower than usual, and I don't see why it should affect your behavior as the author.

7438,145548,COVID-19 - how do I navigate this situation with my advisor?,"I am a Master's student in epidemiology. It's an insane time in our field right now. Of course, I find what's going on fascinating (that's why I am in this field), but extremely stressful as well. 

I have 2 advisors. My primary advisor is not working on COVID-19 related stuff. So, although she's really busy trying to re-plan all of her classes to be remote and just reorganize everything, she is not responding directly to the outbreak. My co-advisor, however, is on the response team for the outbreak in my country. Basically, she is working with the government to create models to predict the trajectory of the disease. I had a meeting with her 1.5 weeks ago and she said basically all she has on her mind is COVID-19. That was before the world went into quarantine so I imagine things have become even busier for her. 

My primary advisor sent me an email today talking about how to move forward and in the email she mentioned that it does depend on how busy my co-advisor is (but also assured me we would figure this all out). 

Unfortunately, the project I am working on now is a modelling project and my primary advisor isn't a modeller, so it's my co-advisor that needs to move the project forward. I still have other things to do for my thesis, but I am almost done those other things and I am just in the editing stages. I have a lot more to do on my modelling project, but my co-advisor is extremely busy right now. I am finished what she asked me to do a couple of weeks ago and want to send it to her.

Sorry for the long post explaining my situation. My question is, should I send her the things the I have finished or would that be a bit tone-deaf? What should I even say in the email? I don't want to come off as not caring about the biggest health crisis in at least a decade while asking her to review something that's not even related to COVID-19. How should I even frame the email or should I hold off from sending her things for a few weeks? 

If it makes a difference, although I do have an office, I can do 100% of my work remotely (and do usually work from home at least 3 days a week). 
",145585,"As someone who's been out of academia for a while, I would like to offer a different perspective. Yes, occupying your co-advisor's attention when the roof is on fire is tone-deaf. However: you have acquired skills that are obviously in high demand these days, and are thrown into a (hopefully) once-in-a lifetime situation to apply these skills. Especially since you're not on a strict deadline with your thesis, there are now more important things than finishing the thesis at the scheduled time. See this as an opportunity, not an obstacle.

Check if this is okay with your primary advisor, then send a mail to your co-advisor saying that you would be glad to put your thesis on ice and help her with her COVID work if she has anything you could be of help with. If you are a capable student, she probably will.  

Then, when things have calmed down, reevaluate the situation, see what you have learned in the meantime, and continue from there.

7484,145645,risk of shifting to online learning permanently,"My university, like many others, has recently moved to remote teaching in response to the corona virus situation. In my department, the faculty have taken the lead on finding and adopting solutions to the difficulties posed by the transition. I am a postdoc and not directly involved in a lot of the big changes. But I wonder if the faculty are sealing their fate, being so helpful when there is a counterparty, the administration, that may not have the faculty's best interests at heart (note, I have no direct knowledge either way). 

Specifically, barring any big disasters in remote teaching these next weeks/months, I would guess 1) smaller schools close to insolvency, many of which have closed these last few years, would instead have an opportunity to cut costs by dispensing with or heavily decreasing in-person instruction, without facing the PR issues or other pushback that would otherwise bring, and 2) even in schools with secure finances, or where it is unrealistic to get rid of in-person instruction, professors would lose a lot of bargaining power in any negotiations with the administration, since they will be regarded as that much less necessarily. Possibly the next few weeks/months will demonstrate that the professors are in fact less necessary, and remote learning is perhaps preferable. I am not really asking about that, my question is more selfish as someone going on the job market soon. Are these outcomes likely? This type of concern must be on the radar of professors' unions, no?
",145685,"Well, based on the 3 institutions I have close contact with, their attempts in the past few weeks hardly represent a shining example of hugely successful online learning! It feels more like the Keystone Kops!

That bit of snark out of the way, effective teaching in the online/MOOC/e-channel, etc. is not easy, and making the transition between a face to face course and an effective online course requires a lot of thought and a lot of design a prep, which of course no-one has has time to do this time around. So my snark was not meant as a true criticism, but at the same time, it means that mainstream universities' efforts in the balance of this semester are themselves unlikely to make anyone -- teachers or learners -- say, ""hey, that went really well; let's dispense with classroom instruction altogether"".

That being said, I do think this will strongly accelerate the shift towards e-learning in the medium- and long-term, and that in 2 ways.


In the long term, this will make e-learning a much more mainstream offering that students and faculty will become more comfortable exploring and integrating into the curriculum. Forced immersion brings familiarity and less fear. Up to now, in North America at least, we tended to have old-school in-person institutions, a few more e-learning focused disruptor institutions, and a select few dabbling in MOOCs layered on top of their usual approach. There was a lot of mutual mistrust. That will lessen. And just like a greater degree of teleworking throughout the economy, with the Pandora's box on it opened, will persist past current social isolation, so will demand for -- and willingness of faculty to explore -- e-learning.
Next year, there will be a lot of financially and emotionally wounded students, whose life plan took a pretty big hit. Some will be keen and able to return to their university campuses and continue as before. Some won't be, and when they get their affairs in order a few years later, in a world that will have lived through months of forced virtual work and socialization, they will probably be keener to explore online offerings than they were previously. And the more they start work somewhere and become mature learners, or the more straitened their financial circumstances become, the more they will seek out good-value-for-money education with schedule and geographic flexibility, and the less they'll be keen to return and pay for the conventional on-campus student experience. Of course that won't apply to all, but I suspect to enough that it will make a difference at the macro level.

7485,145653,"Postdoc position ""on hold"" due to covid-19","I am currently in a job in the US (on STEM OPT). I had a postdoc offer from a large US university that was supposed to start April 16. I signed an offer letter for a two year contract. We were in the process of deciding which visa to apply for (H1/J1). 

Today I got an email from the PI (HR copied) saying she would like to put the position on hold until things settle down. I asked for a clarification on what ""on hold"" meant and whether the offer letter was still valid. The HR replied this (PI copied):


  As for the offer letter you signed (due to redacted’s current
  situation) please consider it void until future notice.
  
  Professor [redacted] will contact you if you are still being considered
  for the position.


This is the last communication I had with the HR or the PI.

What does this mean? Since I have the signed offer, when things do settle down, is the university legally obligated to offer the position back to me before anyone else? Or the university is formally rescinding the offer and I should just move on? Can they do that? 

EDIT: Some answers have asked about my eligibility to work in the US. For clarification: I’m in the US now, in my current status, I can work in the US till the end of May. If the university applied for an H1B (which is typically approved for non profit), I could stay in the US as long as I didn’t leave the country (in which case I would have to get a visa stamped).

There are two possibilities:


The university is unable to pay you, so they are forced to do something that could potentially cause them a lot of harm in the form of bad press or litigation.
They did this voluntarily or out of incompetence, in which case the university is a bad place to work and you are lucky not to be working there.

Who can lose a job due to covid19 in academia? Instructors with annual contracts, postdocs, adjunct-faculty, pre-tenure faculty, tenure faculty, or even all and many could universities shut down.  


Universities Issue Hiring Freezes in Response to COVID-19 
Some offers were withdrawn and one case of layoffs- see comments

",145965,"Of all the examples you name, I think only those on annual contracts have much of any risk and I think that is small. The world isn't actually ending. Universities still have their mission(s): Teaching, Research, Service. That won't change unless the disruptions are much worse than are now foreseen or even likely. 

Course delivery is being affected, but hasn't ended. Research goes on, though interrupted/slowed in some fields for safety. Funding for research is still in place and will probably continue. It will be a boon for some (biomedical) research. 

Some marginal colleges will be in trouble. Think Walden University from the Doonesbury comic, but they were in trouble before this began. Tenure Track professors are unlikely to be affected because they represent the future of the university, not some disposable resource. Postdocs have contracts and funding in place for the most part, often by grants. 

There is even a chance that the current disruption will increase the need for faculty in the short term. 

But for long term effects we need to see how the hundreds to thousands of variables now in play work out over time. And it will take time since universities have quite a bit of built-in inertia. Whether ""cheap online degrees"" have any actual value is something yet to be determined. And they may not be as cheap as you think. Some online programs are extremely expensive to create. And the issue of the actual qualifications of those who take them is important and, perhaps, doubtful. 

But even if a university were to try to deliver such a ""cheap"" degree there is the question of still needing to do research and that requires highly qualified personnel. There isn't a ""cheap online research path"" that has and likelihood of success. 

Diploma mills have a poor history, being more associated with exploitation than with excellence. 

Relax. Stay healthy. Do a good job. Climate change is a bigger risk than what we are going through in the current months. 



Some people normally employed by colleges are at risk, of course. The people who clean the dormitories and prepare meals for resident students, for example. Lots of service jobs are at risk. Likewise, there are lots of small businesses in college towns that are at risk of failure, leaving their employees (including students) without resources. 
",Reasonable,"I don't have any statistics about how common it is, but that shouldn't really concern you. The more important question is whether it is possible. 

I assume, without statistics, that in a competitive job market that many people must, in fact, change their direction. If there are too few jobs then people must look elsewhere or find a way to be more competitive themselves. 

The issue you face is really only finding a job. To do that you have to be attractive to the ones offering the job. Math is a great background on which to build as it gives you analytic and deductive skills that can be brought to bear on many problems. But you can also appear over-qualified for some positions. 

But if you want to work in specific fields, you probably need to get some qualification in those fields, even if it is pretty informal. Employers probably don't want to support you while you learn if it takes too long and there are other, better qualified, candidates. 

Some applied math or statistics might put you in a better position. 

But you need to search out jobs, selecting those that best fit your skills, but also finding a way to promote your skills as appropriate. 

You might, in fact, look for a ""bridge"" position, say as a postdoc, that gives you time and an opportunity to get some qualifications in an applied field that appeals to you.

My advisor hasn't assigned me a project and expects me to come up with one on my own. I don't mind this really, I like the freedom to work on whatever I want. However, this was only really feasible when I was in my lab and surrounded by senior PhD students with whom I could bounce ideas off and get a lot of guidance from. 

However, now I'm stuck at home because of the COVID19 lockdown and don't really know how to productively spend my time doing research. My advisor is busy taking care of his family at home because of the lockdown, so he isn't very responsive right now understandably. I'm all alone at home so I don't have the guidance of senior PhD students either. I've tried messaging senior PhD students but it's not fair for me to constantly be harassing them for help...

However, I have always found it difficult to judge my own progress when studying alone, and with a PhD it seems that it will be especially hard as I need to learn a lot of skills in a new area. Also, because my advisor seems like a very 'nice' person who does not demand that his students work very hard, I am concerned that he will not tell me if I am underperforming.

Would it be appropriate to raise this with my advisor, asking him to tell me if I am not doing as well as his students usually do? Or are there any strategies for people working from home to judge if they are doing enough?
",147005,"Yes, you should raise this issue, both with the advisor and with the university administration. Students need some feedback on their work and it is the university's responsibility to provide a way for that to happen. They need to provide the channels and you need to find a way to use them. 

But things are in a bit of chaos now, of course, and effective response can be slow to occur. 

Virtual seminars are possible using simple or sophisticated software. Perhaps you can set up (or the university can) a group of students and a professor or two willing to have an online session regularly. It isn't the same as face to face, but it can keep you engaged. 

But at a minimum, write a lot and note where you have problems. Ask a lot of questions, but make sure they are pretty focused. Share what you write with your advisor, by email or by posting it somewhere. 

Ask your advisor directly how you are doing and ask explicitly for next steps. You will most likely get suggestions about reading. Take a lot of notes on the readings and note things that puzzle you. Ask about them. 

If you are starting the research phase of the degree it is normally a fairly solitary effort in any case, but the advisor should be willing to review and respond to your efforts and your questions.

you will get credit you find satisfactory. If B is a decent person

7664,147121,In Preparation For The Job Market - On Day 1 of the PhD,"There's a higher likelihood everyday that I am considering pursuing a PhD in my field, and ultimately, in applying for positions as a professor down the road. What I am trying to do is think ahead as to what some extra pieces of my application could include that are not research related. I understand that every field is different, but there are most likely numerous qualities and characteristics on an academic application that are not bound by discipline. So the question I would like to figure out is what type of professional development activities I can work on over the course of my PhD that would contribute to a well-rounded academic resume. 

Obviously, publications are key components in an application and over time those will (hopefully) manifest as research continues. What I am trying to do now is target other areas that will allow me to round out an application in the future. As an example, I am currently taking a Teaching &amp; Learning Program with the Graduate Studies department at my university and the program draws on the ""Science of Teaching and Learning"". In contrast to research papers, this type of thing may be minor, but I feel that developing these sort of auxiliary components to the overall application over time are all important. 

So pursuing development to become a better educator (and this is because I actually want to, not because I feel compelled to) is one thing that I can do in the present to help prepare me for the future. I am wondering what some other things can be done over time (especially over the course of a PhD), that can contribute to a strong application aside from research activities. Below is a list of some things that I have thought of that could be developed over the course of a PhD that could A) help a future application or at least B) make my life easier down the road (haha). 


Developing a sample of introductory course notes for in class &amp; online learning (boo COVID-19)
Pursuing professional development activities in teaching and learning
Developing introductions for certain technologies that have some relevance in my field, but can be overlooked at the undergraduate level (Programming Language or Geographic Information Systems)
Writing tips and advice for undergraduate students 


I debated asking this question, because it sort of feels like a shopping question, although after some thought it felt like more of a professional development question. 
",147124,"Actually the most important thing for you to focus on right now is getting a good research experience and a good relationship with an advisor. Get started on that. Learn to go deep into some subfield of your overall field. Gain expertise in that. 

Along the way, if you want to be an academic, a bit of teaching experience will help, but will be more valuable for some positions than others. But without the ""gain expertise"" part it won't matter much. 

And I caution against trying to choose a field strategically based on what is going on this month. You will graduate, in several years, into a completely different job situation and it is impossible to predict how it will go long in advance. As you get closer to graduation, in four years or so in the US, you can start to broaden your skill set depending on the perceived needs at that time. 

But some things are valuable in any case. Learning to do research. Learning to write. Learning to collaborate. Building a circle of potential collaborators.

But most of the details you suggest are just distractions at this time. Day 1 is the day you look seriously for the best advisor willing to work with you. 
",Reasonable,"Sounds like you are in a bad situation. 

Let me just expand on what previous posters have suggested. I strongly suggest that you find another adviser. If you have peer-reviewed publications, you should be able to find someone who will allow you to graduate even if they are not in your area. Moreover, I don't think it is a big loss, since it sounds like your current adviser may not give you a good recommendation even if you stay with her. 

You should be able to find a postdoc position based on your publications even without a letter from your current adviser. Your postdoc adviser can then write you a letter. Other suggestions for getting a letter include:


The adviser you switch to can write you a letter -- even if they are not in your area, they can comment on working with you, on your communication skills, and the quality of your publications. They can also explain the situation (i.e., why you did not work with the person in your department in your area).
You can bring in an external expert for your thesis committee. This allows an expert in your area to get to know you and your work.
You can meet people at conferences who might be likely to read your paper anyway (because they are working on related things) who might then be willing you write you a letter.


Good luck!

7665,147130,COVID-19 Pass/Fail Option,"I am currently an undergraduate student, and looking to apply to grad schools in the future. In response to COVID-19, my school is offering the ability between choosing the letter grade earned to appear on the transcript, or a pass if you earned over a C, for each individual class. 

I'm wondering if choosing the pass option for one of my classes would reflect poorly on grad school applications. The class in question is a not a major or graduation requirement, and it is 4 credits, so taking a B or lower would hurt my GPA. 

Thank you!

  The class in question is a not a major or graduation requirement


Assuming you want to go to graduate school in a topic closely related to your major, taking one unrelated course pass/fail will not matter under normal circumstances.  It will matter even less because everybody knows students are being encouraged to take classes pass/fail during the pandemic.
",Reasonable,"If you're planning to apply to graduate school in the next year or two and already have any ideas of prospective advisors you'd like to work with, I'd recommend reaching out to them by email to introduce yourself, tell them why you'd like to work with them, and ask whether they have any idea yet about how they will weight this when considering applicants. This has a few advantage:


Depending on the field and program you're entering, acceptance into graduate programs can be much more a matter of an individual professor deciding to take you on as their student than any formal institutional views.
As such, you should absolutely be getting in touch with potential advisors before applying anyway--many professors don't even consider students who haven't reached out in advance before submitting an application.
It's never too early to get in touch, and showing that you're considering this well in advance and are eager enough to work with someone that you're reaching out to them now will reflect well and increase the chances that they'll consider your application more favorably (assuming it's solid) once you do apply.


If you don't know who you'd like to work with but have any ideas about schools you're interested in, you can also email their graduate advisor or dean of grad studies or whatever the person in that role is called there (although again, depending on the field and your career goals, you might want to pay more attention to individual advisors than schools).

With all the above as a disclaimer that the impacts of a P/NP grade will be highly variable and depend on individual schools and advisors... I'll also just say that many, MANY schools are now switching to P/NP options, so you will be far from alone in having a P or two on your transcript from this semester. I have a feeling most professors won't have much choice but to allow for this unless they want to discount pretty much all their applicants for the next few years. Also, to be blunt, an advisor/program that penalizes you for struggling or choosing your mental health over your grades this semester is probably an advisor/program to avoid. Especially if you're saying that a B would bring your GPA down, you can do better than that.

Finally, I don't know your school's specific policy, but many are allowing you to switch from letter grades to P/NP right up until the end of the semester. So you might be able to wait and reevaluate your options after seeing how your grade is doing closer to the deadline. Good luck!

  Selected for competitive summer program, Summer School on ABCDE. Scholarship awarded; attendance cancelled due to COVID-19.
  


I think this is completely appropriate, for the same reasons as argued on this related thread. Note: I added ""scholarhip awarded"", but obviously you should not put that if there was no scholarship :)

In general, the purpose of your CV is to brag as much as possible; include everything that sounds impressive, even if you personally don't think it's that impressive. For instance, if you got accepted to two programs and only could attend one, I would list both. It's the same thing here -- the fact that COVID-19 is the circumstance is just a detail, not relevant to whether the acceptance is appropriate to list.
",Reasonable,"(Expanding my comment into an answer, as suggested by Bryan Krause.)

I think it'd be unusual, and I honestly feel a little weird about it. Perhaps it can be done well, but consider how it would look before doing so. If you're using the quote in support of claims in your research statement, I'd wonder a) is there no support in the literature for that claim (why?), or b) if you're not confident in your own claims. If you instead hope to use the quote in support of your abilities or talent, I think it'd be better to ask the report writer to also write one of your recommendation letters. After all, if they wrote so in the viva report, chances are that they highly enough of you and your work to write a good letter. (It'd also look a lot better on paper than ""X said I'm awesome!"")

The second aspect to consider is if the quotes can be verified. In the systems I'm somewhat familiar with, these reports are usually not publicly available - at least not easily so. This means that those reading your application would likely be unable to confirm that the quotes are valid, making the value of including them kind of dubious. What's more, the report writers might have an expectation that the report isn't made public, and might disapprove of you using their words this way. (Now, you could of course solve that by asking them, but again, if it's central to your application, a recommendation letter would make the point more convincingly.)

Finally, to address your second question: If you choose to do this, you could probably just cite it as company report or internal report, ideally adding a link if it's available online. If your university do make these reports public in a more official manner, it might also be classified as a technical report, but I sort of doubt it. Generally, however, exactly how you cite something in your application probably matters a lot less than what you cite.

For the masters I have found this growing researcher who is doing amazing work and is eager for me to join his lab from the start of the program. Assuming that by the end of the MS, I get ~3.7GPA, a couple co-authored pub and 1 first authored pub in reputed journals along with going to conferences to present my work, altogether getting strong recommendations from the advisor and his colleagues. Will this in any way offset my u-GPA. Also apart from research in masters I have had about 2 years of research experience during undergrad (in and out of school) and have published a paper in a peer-reviewed journal. 

I am looking to get into the biomedical engineering PhD programs at university of chicago, northwestern university, university of pittsburgh, john hopkins university, york university, and university of pennsylvania. Do you think that I am aiming too high? If so, what else should I look to do to improve my chances? Also if I start MS this Fall should I apply for PhD at Fall 2022 or Fall 2023?

Additional Info:


I did a decent undergrad thesis (not great, 8 months), soon after I did a 2 month internship a another research lab. During my undergrad I worked w/ a prof for 1.2 years (Got two papers out - one in a conf and another in a journal). Currently I am working in a top research lab, now remotely due to covid-19 outbreak.
Some people have mentioned other questions thinking that those had the same information that I wanted. But, they did not as the questions talked about how to get into ""a/some"" PhD Program after a low U-GPA and maybe decent masters. The schools that I have mentioned above are ranked pretty high and  would appreciate if you could tailor your answers to my specific question of getting into these schools.
I picked these school not to show of the ""rank"" or ""prestige"" which seems stupid honestly. I chose the because of the strength in the field (F1) that I'm looking to do research in. In one of my previous questions I had mentioned that I got a PhD offer from university of houston which does the research in F1 but it isn't very strong in other area such as: number of grants that they pull in to do amazing research on large patient populations, intellectual cohorts, and industrial connections and startup resources. I picked these schools as I believe them to be the best in F1 and NOT for the main purpose of prestige. So if you don't have anything to suggest I IMPLORE you to not ask me to look at other schools as I did not ask for alternatives but solutions or ideas

",147199,"It is good to aim high. It is also good to have broad target. If you apply to only a few schools with very similar profiles then being rejected by one will probably have a similar outcome at the others. So, I recommend a range of schools if you really want a degree and not just bragging rights about a top 50 school. 

But, about your GPA. It isn't a plus, of course, but most (not all) people who evaluate your application will weight the more recent work as more important than the earlier work. Therefore, if your recent work is good and you have letters that attest to the quality of your work and your dedication, then the older numbers will be discounted by most. 

But, the competition is still very strong and the slots are few. If someone has to make a choice between two candidates, the choice has to be made and lower priority things may bear some weight. 

However, the only way to know whether you have a problem is to actually make application to some places and then evaluate the feedback. There are some questions, like this one, that can only be answered by actually trying. But, you will be more likely to get accepted somewhere if you don't target too narrowly. 
",Reasonable,"In most situations fitting the pattern you describe, you should not ask your colleague.  There are several possible cases:


If the candidate has requested their application be kept confidential, you absolutely must not reach out to them or to anyone else the candidate has not listed as a reference.
If the candidate is currently in a tenure-track or other permanent position, I would not ask without checking with the candidate first, because outing them could be very problematic.
If the candidate is currently in a soft-money or other contingent position, then I would similarly be very careful about asking, but the consequences are not as dire as in the previous case.
If the candidate is in a postdoc or similar position where they are expected to be looking for a permanent position, then asking is a violation of the implied confidentiality of the job application process, but it is a common violation.

7724,147303,Finishing PhD and didn't secure a postdoc position: how to proceed?,"Disclaimer: My PhD supervisor, while not a bad person, is a bad mentor and has given me bad advice in the past. So discussing this with him isn't really productive. I have talked to other people in real life about this, and the opinion of this community would also be welcome.

I'm set to finish my PhD in theoretical physics in September 2020. I applied to several postdocs, got three interviews, and in one I was rated among the top choices but, in the end, I didn't secure any position.

I don't know how similar this is to the fields, but for context I'll explain how postdoc appointments work in (edit: high energy) theoretical physics. In my field, postdoc applications run in cycles. The majority have roughly the same application periods and deadlines (around November), most offers are made at the same time (early January following year) and they all start roughly at the same time (September). There's the occasional outlier, but that's the basic pattern. This means that it's more or less hopeless that I can continue looking for a position, ask professors, etc, for September 2020. If I wanted to stay in academia, I would need to look for a postdoc in the next cycle, starting September 2021.

I am unsure how realistic it is for me to try again or if I should simply throw the towel and quit academia.


First, there's the issue of staying one year academically idle (obviously not professionally idle, that would be insane). I could work on leftover projects from my PhD on my free time, but between finishing my PhD in September 2020 and the deadline for the next cycle on November 2020, that leaves very little time to do so. 
Second, how do I even explain the gap in my cover letter? If I flat out say I failed the previous application cycle, it's a guaranteed trip to the garbage can. Some people have recommended me just lying in vague terms, like I didn't pursue a postdoc immediately after completing my PhD due to ""health concerns that have since been resolved"". I'm unsure if this is a good idea...


If anyone has any other advice regarding my situation besides these two concerns I've raised, that would be welcome too. Basically, I would like to stay in academia as a first preference, but I have no desire to bang my head against the wall against something that, at this point, might be very close to impossible. I don't have any preference for country to work in, so feel free to give country-specific advice.
",147333,"1) First the bad news: The job situation (tenure track) in theoretical high energy physics is not good, covid will not help, having a hard time to get a first postdoc is not a good sign. Having difficulty to get a postdoc is probably not your fault. There are many possible reasons, such as field not a good match, advisor not helpful, institution not a good match. However, it is not clear that the situation will be different next year. 

2) In the past it has been quite uncommon for people to work in the private sector and then return to academia. If it is just a year then you can probably finish another paper or two from your graduate work, and describe your stint as gaining real world experience. I don't think it is true that people will just discard your application, but it does not improve it, either. 

3) The good news is that suddenly there does appear to be a new track. If you are interested in machine learning or quantum information then you can try to get a private sector job in this area, and that does leave open the possibility of returning to academia after you have gained some experience (after two years, for example, or even later than that).
",Reasonable,"You should note that the word ""editor"" is used in many ways for quite different things. Most people understand it to mean ""someone who makes changes/edits to the text"". But that isn't how it is necessarily used. While the publishing industry does, in fact, employ people who do that, working with an author to improve the text, it usually means someone with some management responsibility. 

In the case of your paper, I suspect that a ""managing editor"" (a manager) has assigned your paper to a lower level ""subject editor"" (or some similar term) whose main responsibility is to track the progress of the paper through the system. He or she will find reviewers, track their progress, and collect reviews. When all reviews are in, that ""editor"" will make a recommendation to some higher level ""editor"" about whether to accept or not. If the overall decision is to accept, then your subject editor may assign someone to work with the author on improving the text - a traditional editor. 

I used the term ""subject editor"", not because it is a term of use, but because it describes someone who actually knows a bit about the subject of the paper and which reviewers would be good for getting advice. This is most likely the ""editor"" that the system is referring to. It means, roughly, ""we are handling it and progress is being made"". 

See the Scholarly Books... section of this wikipedia article for the typical usages. ""Project editor"" = ""subject editor"".

",147318,"""Major problem"" is premature. ""Potential major problem"" though - that's likely, depending on what the examiners are disagreeing about. It's possible your thesis is fatally flawed, but it's also possible one of the examiners is wrong.

",Reasonable,"Every university is different. Every student is different. You have picked a set of very demanding schools each of which gets a lot of outstanding candidates each year. I wouldn't worry unnecessarily, but what anyone says here is unimportant except to encourage you to apply. 

I won't be on any of the committees reviewing your admission, but would, myself (mathematician) have no doubts about your success. 

A low GRE score can result from many factors. Some people just don't do as well on such exams as other people do. I always found them pretty easy  but it was just a thing that happened. I also think that such scores are considered only a relatively minor indication of success. 

However, when you apply you will likely be invited for an interview. That is where you really want to shine. Any negatives you think you might have you should be prepared for with an honest answer. And think a lot about what you want to do with such a degree once earned. How do you see yourself in 15 years?

7743,147358,"Avoiding ""Zoom bombing"" in virtual conferences and seminars","With travel restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic, many academics are organizing online seminars and conferences as a substitute for regular in-person university seminars, colloquia, and research conferences.  

In real life, seminars are usually open to anyone who wants to drop in, and every attendee can be seen and heard and may ask questions.  So an obvious approach is to organize the event using video meeting software such as Zoom, and simply post the link on a public website so that any interested person can participate.  However, this also opens the event to ""Zoom bombers"", random people who just want to disrupt the proceedings with annoying or offensive video / audio / text chat - such abuse has unfortunately become very common in public Zoom meetings.

What best practices exist to keep such an event as open as possible to legitimate participants, and let them interact with each other and the speaker in a reasonable way, while reducing the risk of disruption and abuse?

What are the pros and cons of these strategies?

Strategies could be general, or involve specific features of certain software.

Some strategies I've thought of, and their drawbacks:


Create a password for the meeting.  Then the question is, to whom should the organizer give the password?  If they only give it to people they know, it excludes people who might be interested but whom they happen not to know.  If they distribute it to large mailing lists of interested academics, it raises the chance that it will fall into the wrong hands.
Offer to share the password by email upon request.  This requires extra time from the organizer to respond to those emails, and to manually verify the credentials of each requester.
Require a nominal registration fee, as real-life conferences often do.  This requires setting up an online payment system, which can be a lot of work, and may exclude people who are only casually interested, or who don't have funding, or who work in less wealthy parts of the world.  It may also involve the organizer in a lot of bureaucracy with their university as to how the fees will be managed and spent.
Use a ""waiting room"" feature, where participants must be approved immediately before joining.  However, as far as I know, the host only sees the participant's name.  If they see an unfamiliar name, how can they tell whether it is a troll, or a legitimate researcher whom they just happen not to know?  Conversely, I don't think there is anything to stop a troll from masquerading under the name of a famous academic.


I am wondering if people have thought of better solutions, that are specifically appropriate to academia.  Such strategies might take advantage of specific features of the academic community, e.g. to authenticate genuine researchers (.edu addresses? accounts on preprint servers? ORCid IDs?).  Answers could also address the pros and cons of such strategies as they apply to academia in particular, and how well they fit with people's existing expectations for academic conferences.
",147374,"How about using something other than Zoom? Other softwares support features that can help with this. Moreover there are some serious security and privacy concerns about Zoom (see e.g. this statement by the FBI and this investigation by the NY attorney general; Bruce Schneier has written an overview of the concerns here).

In our department we use BigBlueButton (website, Wikipedia) for our classrooms and seminars. It's a completely open-source and free web conferencing system. There are a few services out there that host servers but they're completely overloaded at the moment. I'd say your best bet would be to get your IT services to host a server for your department. With BBB by default new users don't have their webcams activated, and you can prevent them from doing so. You can even prevent them from using their microphone and require them to virtually ""raise their hand"" before a moderator allows them to speak. That should cut down a lot of the abuse. You can also set up the service so that an account is required before accessing the meeting. Unless the abuser is very dedicated, they probably won't bother creating dozens of accounts to continue bothering people after being kicked out, I hope.

Also, something obvious: many abusers are specifically targeting Zoom and going into random Zoom meetings. Unless you've somehow attracted abusers who are specifically targeting you, if you use something else (especially something hosted by your own department), you probably won't have any problems.

Note: I'm only recommending BBB because that's what we use at our department, but there are other services out there. I know another department has set up something called ""Panopto"" for example, and another something called ""Classilio"" - you'll have to look that up, I don't know much about it. For informal meetings we use Jitsi but it doesn't seem adequate for hosting a seminar. But in any case, if a software doesn't meet your requirements, you should definitely look into switching to something else, especially with the privacy concerns...

7766,147462,How one legally can justify distance learning for on campus programs?,"A few years ago we wanted to open a new program that will be based on distance learning,  however, getting accredited for having a master degree program that is based on distance learning and not on campus is literally a bureaucratic nightmare.
First, no one allowed us to use Zoom, Microsoft Teams or other currently popular distance learning tools, second it should be some sort of  ""Moodle"" program with clear guidelines for each week. Third everything needs to be under guidelines of the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, in current COVID19 teaching organizational crisis we don't follow those guidelines at all.
I wonder what are legal repercussions for doing distance learning when you are not accredited to do one. Can our students with disability complain since when they needed this option we couldn't provide to them since our excuse was that we weren't ready or accredited to do so? And last but not least, can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?
",147468,"Edit: this answer is somewhat specific to the context of the COVID-19 health crisis and about legal justifications for various exceptional teaching strategies being adopted by many universities all over the world these days. It’s not clear if that’s what you meant to ask about exactly. If it’s not, please clarify.



The COVID-19 situation and the way universities are responding to it is an illustration of the adage that “it is easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission”. Basically the situation is so unprecedented that universities are doing whatever they can to stay operational, and leaving legal questions for later. My guess is that these will all be addressed by governments, legislatures, and regulatory bodies at a later time when the people in charge emerge out of panic mode and have time for dealing with such issues.

At the same time, the question of legality is indeed significant, and people are in fact paying attention. For example, in the US, I have heard that the visas of many foreign students explicitly forbid “online learning”. As a result, I have also heard (this is basically gossip and I can’t confirm it or cite a reference) that some institutions are referring to their current mode of operation as “remote learning” in a euphemistic attempt to pretend that that’s conceptually different from “online learning”. Silly? Perhaps, but that’s the kind of advice lawyers are giving apparently. Similar fig-leaf, CYA-style advice is being given about protecting your Zoom class meeting with a password to avoid being accused of compromising your students’ privacy. Does that mean using Zoom is technically legal in the sense of being fully FERPA-compliant? Who knows - probably not. But at least we make an effort to minimize whatever legal issues we have time to think about and energy to do something about.

But the short answer is, in the academic context as well as other contexts having to do with civil liberties, restrictions on people’s movements and many other aspects of our daily lives that are being disrupted, the law is lagging far behind. People in charge will do whatever they need to do without asking for permission, and ask for forgiveness later if they have to (they probably won’t).
",Reasonable,"Perhaps the bureaucratic jungle can be skirted: Offer an on-campus program, deliver material digitally, and make a room available for screenings of that material. Deliver office hours, tutorials, etc. digitally too, allowing students to be in the room, should they choose. You are offering an on-campus program. You're also doing an excellent job of catering for students that can't make class, e.g., they're sick, their kid is sick, their car broke down, ... As it turns out, your program is also excellent for distance learning. 

Perhaps you'd fall foul under inspection, then you're reliant on begging for forgiveness, as Dan mentioned. Get your head of department on-board, get a legal opinion.


  can we legally organize accredited on-campus program but perform it online or using distance learning completely?


That's a legal question, INAL, but perhaps an accredited on-campus program can be delivered without any students present... And, if that happens, it'd make economic sense to drop the screening room, students can use existing computer facilities (typically paid from someone else's budget).

Would it be out of line for me to send an email along the lines of ""Hi professor, I'm sorry to hear your loved one passed.""

That is however typically only the case in my area when you work with them as an assistant, are doing a thesis with them or have a very small specialist class. If you only know him from hearing a lecture of 50+ students, it might well appear that you consider your relationship more personal than it is, i.e. are slightly violating social norms. However, this should normally just be taken as an oddity. So if you err in that direction it's no big deal, but it's also no issue if you don't send a mail in basically all cases that fit the question. So you can relatively safely do what feels right to you.

As a guideline, the more you already know about him beyond his professional capacity, the more likely it will be seen as appropriate. And the more your relationship so far has been distanced and purely professional the more likely it may come of as odd. A simple check is also to consider how many other students would be at the same level of closeness. When you announce something like this, a handful of mails from people that you know is sweet. Five hundred mails from five hundred peoples whose names you don't know unless you look into your student register is more a (still well meant) nuisance than a help to most people.

",Accepted,"The quick answer: it is not so much that part of your death star gets sliced away as that the death star as a whole will have an extremely hard time escaping even with maximum thrust, and the part below the horizon definitely will not escape. Either the ship tears itself apart or falls in.

Long answer: you approach the black hole along what normally would be a hyperbolic flyby trajectory. Sitting in the control room you do not experience any force, since you are in free-fall along a geodesic curve. 

But as you get closer the structure starts to creak: different parts of the death star are at different distance from the black hole and subjected to different spacetime curvature. This produces tidal forces that try to pull and squeeze the spherical death star into an ellipsoid pointed at the black hole. You are however smug, since you choose a supermassive black hole and hence the tidal forces are not that severe, even at the horizon. Had you used a non-spherical spacecraft there would also had been a torque trying to rotate you, but again, death stars for the win.

Now you get very close to the event horizon, skimming it. The view outside looks decidedly weird (since you are inside the photon sphere and having relativistic aberration). At this point trouble appears: your free-fall trajectory does not continue back out to infinity, but spirals into the black hole! Unlike in Newtonian gravity close free-fall trajectories do not return out. The reason is that you are inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). The only trajectories in this region that do not end up in the black hole are sufficiently steeply outgoing ones.

So you turn on your super-thrusters and try to break free by increasing your velocity in the right direction. But now you have a problem: the part of the death star furthest from the black hole needs merely a lot of extra velocity to be on a trajectory that leaves the hole region. The innermost part needs to move faster than light to break free. So if you can achieve some maximum boost there are going to be parts that, had they not been connected to the superstructure but freely flying, would not escape. So your boost turns into stress across the death star. Something has to give, and no matter what boost you are giving the innermost parts through the engines and pulling metal they will not move outward since they are below the horizon.

It is at this point I strongly recommend running to the escape pods. 

Exactly what the fate of the death star will be depends on a lot of things, but the simplest case is that the overall boost is insufficient and it all falls in. It might also break apart. Relativity shows that there are no perfectly rigid materials (they would need to have a speed of sound faster than light), so not even an imaginary death star will avoid getting pulled apart. 

In the end, I leave you to explain your little joyride to the Emperor. 

[It is worth noting that nothing looks strange locally when you cross an event horizon. It is a global property of spacetime, not something you can directly see. Extended objects crossing it merely have some parts whose future trajectories will meet the singularity, and the parts just outside may meet the singularity, but can escape if they break away somehow.]

A source said 132 fahrenheit for 30 minutes. I wanted to calculate how much energy that would take so then I could easily find out how long I would have to microwave an object to get the same results.

All I want is just how much energy is put into maintaining this 132 fahrenheit for half an hour at a room temperature. A formula would be fine because I want to be able to apply this to other problems that might come up.
",541156,"The amount of energy required to maintain water at some temperature over some time is simply equal to the amount of energy that the water loses to the environment over that time.

It depends on the conditions that the water is in, specifically how much heat the water is losing the environment. For example, it will take more energy to maintain water at 132 F when you place it in a cold windy environment because it's losing lots of heat in that environment.

So let's say you have a simple scenario of a pot of water sitting in room temperature. A simple energy balance on your water gives:

$$ q_{in} = hA_s(T-T_0) $$

Where $q_{in}$ is the input power, $h$ is an effective heat transfer coefficient telling how much heat the water loses to the ambient (typical value of 5-10 $W/m^2K$ for a 56 C object sitting in a room with no wind), $A_s$ is the surface area of your water container, $T$ is the temperature of the water (56 C), and $T_0$ is room temperature (25 C).

So, all you need is the surface area of your water container. Then solve for the required power $q_in$, and multiply by time (30 min) to get the required energy.

$$ Q_{in} = tq_{in} $$ 

Where $t$ is the time you desire (30 min). That's how you do it.

10451,542475,"In the Feynman Path Integral, why must ""contributing paths"" be continuous? Or is this a false notion?","I have been studying the Feynman path integral and its various derivations, and I've run into a bit of a problem. The standard Feynman path integral appears as follows:
$$
\int \mathcal{D}[x(t)]\exp\left(\frac i \hbar \int_0^t d\tau\ \left( \frac m2 \dot{x}(\tau) - V(x(\tau) \right) \right)
$$
Where the path integral is defined by passing the following into the continuum limit:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}\idotsint d^{n-1}x\ \mathcal{N} \exp\left( \frac i \hbar \sum_{j=1}^n \left( \frac m2 \left( \frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{\Delta t} \right)^2 - V(x_j) \right) \Delta t \right)
$$ 
where $\Delta t = t/n$. In this form, we independently integrate each $x_j$ from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$, and hence there is no innate notion that the paths considered must be continuous; $x_{j+1}$ and $x_j$ can be as far apart as we please. 

In doing readings, I have found multiple sources that claim that the paths we consider are continuous, for example in this paper. In transforming to imaginary time ($-t \to -i\tau$), this claim makes sense, since discontinuities in the path will blow up the the sum and they will be exponentially suppressed. However, in the form presented above, I am not quite sure where and how we can make this claim.

I have seen the argument that paths that deviate greatly from the classical path will lead to extreme oscillatory behavior from our phase, and hence will be suppressed since they will on-average integrate to zero. However, I don't think I am satisfied with this argument to claim we must have continuity. This shows which paths contribute the most, but I don't think it rules out discontinuous paths. Does anyone have insight into this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
",542484,"The paths of a Feynman integral do not always have to be continuous, and the first example that comes to my mind is the Feynman integral in the Feynman-Vernon formalism, which is used to study the spin-boson model, among other things.

For the spin-boson problem, the $x(t)$ paths written in your question, are discontinuous. If the spin in your spin-boson problem is a spin-1/2 particle, then $x(t)$ will be either -1/2 or +1/2 at each time $t$, and the Feynman integral will be over all possible paths, of which I'll give four examples below: 


$x(t)$ = -1/2 for all $t$.
$x(t)$ = +1/2 for all $t$.
$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, and $x(t)$=+1/2 for the rest of the time.
$x(t)$ = -1/2 from $t=0$ to $t$=5ps, $x(t)$=+1/2 from $t$=5ps to $t$=10ps, then $x(t)$=-1/2 for the rest of the time.


If you allow all possible flips between spin-up and spin-down between $t=0$ and the rest of your desired time for the Feynman integral, there will be an infinite number of such paths. 

The software FeynDyn (Feynman Dynamics) can calculation such Feynman integrals for up to 16 spin-1/2 particles (or 16 qubits, if simulating a quantum computer in the presence of noise) and more information about this whole ""Feynman-Vernon"" formalism can be found in this paper (I have given a free link to the PDF rather than the original journal, in case COVID lockdown has caused you not to be on a campus where you can download papers easily). 
",Accepted,"My understanding is that most paths are inherently discontinuous, and the transition to functional integration is a symbolic one.

However, many applications of path integrals are centered on the stationary phase approximation, which in case of path integrals cited in the question corresponds to a quasi-classical trajectory and small fluctuations around it. In this limit the contribution of discontinuous paths is indeed negligeable.

An electrical coronal discharge happens when the electric field near an object is high enough to ionize the air; it makes a spiky glow that looks kind of like a crown. The ionized air molecules can participate in chemical reactions that aren't available to neutral air molecules, and that chemistry is a factor in the aging of high-voltage electrical systems.

14071,538796,Has anyone tried to find the wavelength to the Corona virus cell?,"I have seen websites and videos that show how cancer cells can be destroyed using sound resonance oscillation. So has anyone heard of anyone who is in the field of sound resonance trying to capture the wavelength of the Corona virus so we can create a Sonogram machine to use against this virus pandemic?
",538809,"It's a nice idea. Sadly it won't work but there is still some interesting physics involved.

As a general rule resonance is only an efficient way to transfer energy to an object if that object has a high Q factor. A high Q factor means the energy supplied builds up and increases the amplitude of the oscillation, and this may get large enough to damage the object. This is the (alleged) mechanism for the shattering of wine glasses by overenthusiastic sopranos. Wine glasses have a high Q and you can tell this by the way they ring for a while when you tap them. As a contrast, potatoes have a low Q and do not ring when you tap them. So our sopranos would have a hard time shattering a potato.

The problem with using ultrasound to kill cells or viruses is that in general they are squishy low Q objects like potatoes, not high Q objects like wine glasses, and they do not store the energy of the sound efficiently enough for the amplitude of oscillation to build up to destructive levels. So the technique simply won't work.

Ultrasound is used to kill tumours, but this does not work by resonance - the energy in the sound simply heats the cancer tissue and kills it. It is used for tumours because the sound can be focused onto the tumour where it causes local heating. This would not work for viral infections since the virus is distributed throughout the body not concentrated in one area onto which the sound can be targeted.

Even if viruses were brittle like glass it would still be hard to make them resonate enough to be damaged when they are in a fluid like water. There are two reasons for this.

Firstly water is much denser and much more viscous than air so it efficiently damps the vibrations of any objects moving in it. For example if you tap a glass underwater it will not ring as it does in air. So even objects that have a high Q factor in air will have a drastically lower Q factor in water. This applies to viruses in humans since as far as sound waves are concerned human tissue is little different from water.

Secondly sound waves are a compression wave and they propagate by alternately compressing and expanding the water. The amount the water compresses and stretches is determined by the bulk modulus and this is relatively high. That means the amplitude of the wave is small unless the energy is very high, and consequently the mechanical deformation of objects in the water by the wave is small. This makes it hard to deform the virus enough to damage it.
",Reasonable,"There is a difference between cancer and a virus infection. 

A virus invades a cell and uses it to produce more virus. These go on to invade more cells. Many viruses reproduce so much that the cell bursts. To many dead cells kills the patient, or at least makes him sick. 

Cancer is a problem where the patient's cells malfunction. They reproduce uncontrollably. The mass of growing cells is called a tumor. A tumor can kill the patient. One ""cure"" for cancer is to kill just the out of control cells. 

If you applied this approach to a virus, you would have to kill more or less all the cells in the patient.

I am taking one pack of mentioned coffee (21 grams in one package), pouring it with with freshly boiled water, mixing the coffee with water using a teaspoon in room-temperatured cup, then I am going to the toilet for ~5-7 minutes. When I come back from the toilet, my coffee is ready to drink. It is hottish, but I can drink it right away.

I am pouring two teabags (4 grams of tea) with the same amount of freshly boiled water, and I make my breakfast. It usually takes me around 10 minutes to make my breakfast, and when I am trying to drink my tea right after finishing making by breakfast, it is still hot as hell.

",541845,"I can think of two possible differences which might contribute this result, but I am not sure how you could test them. The different composition of the drinks will affect the surface tension. This could affect the rate of evaporation of the liquid. If this is the case, it may make a substantial difference to the rate of cooling as evaporation is probably the greatest cause of loss of temperature.

The other cooling effect which will be different is radiation. Do you add milk to your tea? If the coffee is darker than the tea, it will radiate faster and cool faster for that reason. 

If you don't add milk, the tea will be translucent. I am not exactly sure how that will affect things, because it means that radiation is possible from the interior, not just the surface. Also it may not be translucent for the wavelengths radiated. But generally, I think a translucent substance will radiate much less. 
",Reasonable,"Yes, I think $1\,\mathrm{lx}$ is indeed absurdly low for a flashgun of any reasonable capacity.

A very brief intuitive argument as to why this is is that the flashes from flashguns last for under $1/1000\,\mathrm{s}$ and yet, distances of the order of $1\,\mathrm{m}$, they can light scenes brightly enough in that time to be equivalent to an exposure of $1/100\,\mathrm{s}$ of the same scene in full sunlight.



Below I have tried to put a numerical value on how bright a flash must be for a particular (non-exceptional) model.  I suspect that this contains errors, but it bears out the intuitive argument above.

Although I don't know how bright cellphone flashes are, it's possible to work out how bright camera flashes are since they publish enough information.  As an example, I took the Pentax F-360 FGZ II flashgun (manual: this was just the first I found in a page of flashes and it looks like a non-stupidly-powerful one: I presume it is brighter than cellphone flashes).  This has a 'guide number' of $36$ (in metres, at ISO $100$: see below), and at full brightness it lights for $1/1200\,\mathrm{s}$.

The first thing to sort out is how large an area the flash illuminates at a given distance, $d$.  I will assume that it covers enough area for a $50\,\mathrm{mm}$ lens on $35\,\mathrm{mm}$ film with a fudge factor of $2$ (so, twice the area).  Such a lens has an angle of view, $\alpha \approx \pi/8$ (45 degrees in old money).  So assuming a standard $3/2$ film frame, I get that the area covered, $A$ is

$$
A = 2 \times \frac{24}{13}\left(d\tan\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\right)^2
$$

Where the  $24/13$ comes from fitting a film frame into the image circle of the lens, and the $2$ is the fudge factor (the flash covers some rectangle which is going to be significantly bigger than the film frame or there will be vignetting), which is probably really quite a lot larger than $2$.  And I may have made mistakes in this but it's good enough.

So now, rather than think about lumens or lux which will require knowing the albedo of whatever the camera is looking at, I will work out how bright the flash must be compared to full sunlight.  This is helped by knowing the famous sunny 16 rule, known to all photographers of a certain age:


  in full sunlight, you get reasonable exposures with a film of ISO speed $S$ by exposing for $1/S\,\mathrm{s}$ at $f/16$.


And now we come to the nightmare of flash guide numbers, which are not numbers but quantities with dimensions.  The basic definition of a guide number, for a given film (or sensor) speed $S$ is that

$$
G_S = \frac{d}{a}
$$

where $a$ is the aperture of the lens.  $a$ is dimensionless (it's the ratio between the focal length and the effective diameter of the lens), so the units of $G_S$ are length.  This definition works because the light that gets into the lens goes as the square of the aperture $a$, and the amount of illumination falls of as the square of distance $d$.  And really I should factor in $S$ here but I've just defined $G$ at a given speed, $S$.

So for the flash referenced at the top of this answer, we know that $G_{100} = 36\,\mathrm{m}$, and since we're interested in $f/16$ because we know the sunny 16 rule, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
d &amp;= \frac{G_{100}}{16}\,\mathrm{m}\\
  &amp;= \frac{36}{16}\,\mathrm{m}\\
  &amp;= \frac{9}{4}\,\mathrm{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, as $f/16$ &amp; using ISO $100$ film, this flash will light something a bit over $2\,\mathrm{m}$ away.

But it does this in $1/1200\,\mathrm{s}$, and in fact I will add another fudge factor of $2$ here, because the flash isn't a perfect top-hat function, it will ramp up and down.  So I'll assume that it does it in $1/2400\,\mathrm{s}$.  In other words, at this distance, it lighting the scene $24$ times more brightly than the Sun, because the Sun takes $1/100\,\mathrm{s}$ to do the same thing.

And finally we can work out the area it must illuminate from above: we now know that $d = 9/4\,\mathrm{m}$ and $\alpha = \pi/8$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &amp;= 2 \times \frac{24}{13}\left(\frac{9}{4}\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right)\right)^2\\
  &amp;\approx 0.74\,\mathrm{m^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

So based on the lux table here, full sunlight might be $50\times 10^3\,\mathrm{lx}$, so this flashgun must be putting about $1200\times 10^2\,\mathrm{lx}$ into an area of about $0.74\,\mathrm{m^2}$.

I'm kind of uncomfortable with this working, because I'm unwilling to believe flashguns are that bright (note there are two fudge factors here which could reduce things by a factor of $4$ though).  But I think it is very clear that, yes, $1\,\mathrm{lx}$ is absurdly low as the brightness of a flashgun.

Suppose some website gets mentioned on Reddit and the post happens to hit the first page. It gets the ""Reddit hug of death"" (the swarm of reddit users overwhelm the website's servers, and it becomes unavailable). You could ask the same question:


  How is it possible that the producers of [this site] give up on additional earning by not [spinning up more servers], now that it's pretty obvious the demand is going up?


If that ""additional earning"" (of having more of your product available to provide) is less than it costs to permanently over-provision a resource (web servers, mask production factories, etc.), then it's not economical to do so.

Cloud infrastructure is becoming incredibly liquid, because resources are very flexible and can be pooled. A high traffic day for my website might be a low traffic day for yours. A cloud provider could scale down your site (saving you money) by uninstalling your software from a server, reassigning that server to me, and use it to scale up my site by installing my software on it (raising my infrastructure costs, but also raising my business' income because it hasn't gone down). There are even auto-scaling systems that can scale your service up and down in response to current load. There's still some lead time, on the order of a few minutes for web server virtual machines.

The real world is much less flexible than software. If masks are in hot demand, but construction helmets aren't, you can't re-purpose the injection molds for hard hats into face-mask stitching machines. There are many factors involved in deciding whether or not its worth in investing to grow the mask manufacturing business:


How many masks are available in reserve? In the warehouses of factories and distributors, in hospitals, in military bases, etc.
How long do we think this epidemic will last? Will it last long enough to deplete the reserves? Is it long-term enough to justify the high up front expenses?
How much marginal profit is there to be made in selling these extra masks?


Interestingly, this problem repeats itself and plays itself out upstream in the supply chain. Are the companies that make mask-stitching machines able to produce enough for the new demand? What about their upstream supply chain?

3101,34494,Won't countries be in trouble if all sovereign debtors demand payment?,"I'm trying to understand this r/explainlikeimfive analogy. I rectified typos, and simplified some  names and numbers. 


Won't Cal demand  his principal back at some time in the future? 
Similarly, won't countries' sovereign debts demand their principal? 
For example, China holds much US treasuries and US sovereign debt. If China thinks COVID-2019 will cripple the US and wants to park its money else where, won't China demand all of its principal from the US so that it can buy Australia or New Zealand sovereign debt instead? 



  'Country A owes \$10  to country B, and has agreed to pay 2% interest annually. Call this Debt X.
  
  Country B owes \$15  to country A, and has agreed to pay 1% interest annually. This is Debt Y.
  
  Investor A is willing to purchase Debt X for \$12, because he values the steady rate of return, and believes country A is very likely to pay its debts. He isn't as sure about Debt Y, but he is willing to pay \$16 for it. Investor B thinks that investor A is going to change his mind about Debt Y and value it more highly, so he is willing to pay \$17 for it today.
  
  Debt is traded constantly and it's valued differently. Just because 2 countries owe each other similar amounts of money, doesn't mean the value cancels out in any meaningful way.
  
  Think of debt this way. You and your three brothers all own a house together. Each year you take up a collection of \$1000 a head for \$~4k annual upkeep on the house. One year, a tree falls on the roof, and the house needs another \$4000 bucks. Everyone could just chip in 1k each, but one brother is having a tough year, so instead, you loan the house \$4k, with the expectation that it will pay you 1% interest a year.
  
  Your brothers agree, and over the years, this comes up a few more times. You even use debt to finance installing a new hottub. You now own \$20k in debt from the house, 1 brother owns \$5k, and for some weird reason, your neighbor Cal wants to purchase the debt from you. (He really thinks your household is trustworthy, and wants somewhere to park \$20k for 1% interest).
  
  Now C owns \$20k of debt from your house, so C owns 80% of all your house's debt. Would you say C owns your house now? Well of course not, your house is likely worth many times more what C has claim to. If someone in your house is super worried about the situation, they could take up a collection in the house to buy the debt back from C, but it's not a popular idea, because most people can think of better things to do with their money than pay off C so they don't have to make the small yearly interest payments.

",34495,"
The principal has to be repaid eventually but with majority of formal debt instruments such as government bonds the creditor can’t just demand repayment whenever he or she wants. Most debt instruments have pre-specified date and if not date then conditions when and how the principal is being paid back.


For example a standard 10year bond will pay its principal in 10 years not a day earlier (unless you actually manage to convince the debtor to voluntary agree to pay it sooner).


The above works for sovereign countries too. A 10 year government bond will have on it printed that principal is payed back exactly after 10years. 


Now this is outside economics, but technically sovereign nations are in state of anarchy so I can imagine one country could just decide to say to another pay now or we will invade you/nuke you etc. but aside of some military intervention there is no way of legally forcing the country to pay.

In fact any government can, in principle, default on its debts anytime it wants. The only constraint on sovereign default is that if you constantly default on your debt nobody will want to lend you money in the future, or if only at punitively high interest. Hence on sovereign level governments as debtors have much better bargaining power than just individuals.

Government can be forced to pay its debt only through military action, or in some cases by diplomatic pressure (for example EU could threaten Greece by revoking its euro-zone or EU membership, US could threaten countries by economic sanctions etc.). Aside from that there is nothing other country can do to get its money back if debtor nation says no.


Based on 1, and 2 you probably already know the answer. No that’s not possible. China could patiently wait for bonds to expire and then not buy new US bonds but instead buy Australian or New Zeeland bonds. Of course, since there is a lot of debt being issued by US government probably every month there are bonds expiring and being replaced by new ones so China could start do it sooner than later.


Also beside of that, usually when people want to get rid of a debt they won’t wait for maturity and for repayment of the principal. They will take the bond to bond market and sell it at market price to get money now. That creates a trouble for country in a sense that now it has to set lower price or higher interest on its newly issued bonds due to increased supply, but whether this becomes a problem depends on plethora of factors many unrelated to the original debtor and creditor countries, such as how big is the demand for the debtors bonds etc.

McKibbin and Fernando (2 March 2020) The Global Macroeconomic Impacts of COVID-19: Seven Scenarios


  examines the impacts of different scenarios on macroeconomic outcomes and
  financial markets in a global hybrid DSGE/CGE general equilibrium model.
  The scenarios in this paper demonstrate that even a contained outbreak could significantly
  impact the global economy in the short run. [...]
  These results are very sensitive to the assumptions in the model, to the shocks we feed in and
  to the assumed macroeconomic policy responses in each country.

And that's already cited by Wang et al. COVID-19's Impact on China's Economy Based on Data of Spring Festival Travel Rush


  this paper starts with the analysis of the daily railway passenger volume data during the Spring Festival travel rush, and establishes three time series to model the railway passenger volume, GDP in the first quarter model, and GDP in the last three quarters respectively. The forecast results indicate that: (a) Affected by the epidemic, China’s economy will lose 4.8 trillion yuan in the first quarter of 2020, which is an expected decrease of 20.69% and a year-on-year drop of 15.60%; (b) China's expected GDP growth rate for the full year of 2020 will reduce from 6.50% to 1.72%. However, there are some positive factors not taken into account in these models, which means that the forecast results may be underestimated. With the global spread of the epidemic, the instability of the world economy will in turn impact China’s economy.

A more recent (March 30) paper, Greenstone and Nigam that emphasizes/quantifies the benefits of the lockdowns, in the US:


  Using the Ferguson et al. (2020) simulation model of COVID-19’s spread and mortality impacts in the United States, we project that 3-4 months of moderate distancing beginning in late March 2020 would save 1.7 million lives by October 1. Of the lives saved, 630,000 are due to avoided overwhelming of hospital intensive care units. Using the projected age-specific reductions in death and age-varying estimates of the United States Government’s value of a statistical life, we find that the mortality benefits of social distancing are about \$8 trillion or $60,000 per US household. Roughly 90% of the monetized benefits are projected to accrue to people age 50 or older. Overall, the analysis suggests that social distancing initiatives and policies in response to the COVID-19 epidemic have substantial economic benefits.





JP Morgan has put out some estimates already, although they don't detail their methodology as much as a peer-reviewed publication would (have to).


  The U.S. economy is projected to contract by 14% in the second quarter, after experiencing a 4% contraction in the first quarter, before recovering to 8% and 4% growth in the third and fourth quarters. Euro area GDP will suffer an even deeper contraction, with double-digit declines of 15% and 22% in the first and second quarters, before rebounding by 45% and 3.5% in the third and fourth quarters.
  
  “There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. We now think that the COVID-19 shock will produce a global recession, as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,” said Bruce Kasman, Chief Economist at J.P. Morgan. Initially, the expectation was the novel-recession may generate limited labor market damage, but J.P. Morgan Research is now forecasting the unemployment rate for developed markets as a whole will rise 1.6 percentage points in the next two quarters.
  
  “The rise in unemployment will be sharper in the U.S. than in the Euro area. Most immediately, U.S. initial jobless claims should spike above 400,000 in the coming weeks,” said Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.


McKinsey has a somewhat spread-out (March 25) presentation, but a couple of slides with their scenarios/estimates I could fish from there:




Likewise, PWC has a March [white]paper mostly focused on Australia... but which does come with a global map attached of their estimates of GDP losses, alas in absolute figures only (and I think over one year based on what they say on the previous slide):





Before the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a niche academic domain of estimating the economic impact of pandemics already, typically using a CGE model. Results depend of course on the assumptions used. E.g. Smith, Keogh-Brown et al. had a series of papers approximately a decade ago. Quoting from a later one that covered more than one European country:


  Results suggest GDP losses from the disease of approximately 0.5–2% but school closure and prophylactic absenteeism more than triples these effects.


So they went as high ~10% GDP losses. While they did not envisage government mandated lockdown(s), they modelled ""prophylactic absenteeism"" in response to ~3% death rate media reports as the most severe case. An earlier paper of theirs, on UK only is open-access in the BMJ. Quoting their assumption from there


  almost everybody in the population will know someone who has died once the mortality rate reaches one death per 300 people, triggering prophylactic absenteeism.


The same authors (Keogh-Brown and Smith) also published in 2008 a fairly detailed post-hoc account of how economic predictions for SARS fared in hindsight... which generally wasn't all that good, meaning that most models overestimated the economic impact of SARS. It cites positively an 2003 ADB paper of Fan that hedged its bets on two different scenarios (early containment being one of them).

Another paper Verikios et al. (2015) in a similar vein but attempts a global estimate (GTAP CGE), and also discussed prior/related work:


  The two pandemic scenarios modelled give quantitatively and qualitatively different
  results. [...] Our results show that the peak GDP effects on the world economy of an influenza pandemic are in the range 0.06 to 1.01 per cent in the peak year depending on the nature of the pandemic. Our results are smaller than the only previous estimates of the global economic effects of influenza pandemics by McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006). They estimate reductions in global GDP of between 0.8 and 12.6 per cent depending on the severity of the pandemic. Our results are not directly comparable to McKibbin and Sidorenko as they did not model a continuum of pandemic scenarios across the virulence-infectiousness continuum. Rather, they assume a given reproducibility of the virus (infectiousness) and vary virulence across their four scenarios. Further, they implicitly assume multiple waves for all their scenarios as they presume that
  new infections continue to occur for greater than one year. This is likely to characterise only more extreme pandemics (such as the 1918–19 flu) rather than milder pandemics. Differences in the range of influenza pandemics modelled by us and McKibbin and Sidorenko are justifiable given the uncertain nature of future pandemics. Our results thus build upon the findings of McKibbin and Sidorenko by extending the estimation of potential GDP estimates over a further range of potential pandemic threat scenarios.
  
  [...] Our results show that the global macroeconomic effects of an influenza pandemic may be significant but are also likely to be short-lived. The largest economic impacts of an influenza pandemic are driven by reduced international tourism, due to risk-modifying measures by households and travel restrictions imposed by health authorities, and lost workdays, due to illness or formal social distancing measures designed to contain the virus. This is consistent with the work of Keogh-Brown et al. (2009, 2010). [...] 


Verikios seems to work for KPMG Australia nowadays and they have released a COVID-19 model that is fairly detailed in explaining its assumptions, for example it has separate pre- and post-stimulus arms/scenarios, but it mostly covers the Australian case, in particular only models the government response of that country.

KPMG uses a NiGEM (New-Keynesian) macro model, and they've basically tweaked some parameters of this using estimates of shocks in four areas: reduction in productivity due to additional sick leave by workers, reduction in productivity due to additional carer’s leave by workers, incremental investment premium, capacity utilisation adjustment (i.e. supply chain disruptions). The first two were informed by fairly detailed labour &amp; health statistics, the latter two seem a bit more arbitrary to me, e.g. they added a flat 1% investment premium.



I was hoping the IMF would have something more concrete than this, but I guess
they are weary of advancing anything more detailed yet:


  The COVID-19 pandemic would cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but world economic output should recover in 2021, the IMF said on Monday.
  
  Georgieva issued the new outlook after a conference call of G20 finance ministers and central bankers, who she said agreed on the need for solidarity across the globe. [...]
  
  The outlook for global growth is negative and the IMF expects “a recession at least as bad as during the global financial crisis, or worse,” Georgieva said.
  
  Earlier this month, Georgieva had warned that 2020 world growth would be below last year’s 2.9 percent rate, but stopped short of predicting a recession.
  
  Georgieva on Monday said that a recovery is expected in 2021, but to reach it, countries would need to prioritize containment and strengthen health systems.
  
  “The economic impact is and will be severe, but the faster the virus stops, the quicker and stronger the recovery will be,” she said.


The CBO has now posted its own assessment for the US economy. It disclaims that it is ""highly uncertain, especially for later periods"", but basically, for the second quarter of 2020 it predicts 10 percent unemployment and the economy to contract by ""more than"" 7 percent.

3214,34624,Won’t paying wages to temporarily unemployed due to Coronavirus result in inflation?,"UK government promises to pay 80% of wages for people unemployed due to coronavirus. I am not economist, so I am probably missing something, but shouldn’t paying wages to unemployed due to coronavirus result in inflation due to decreased products and services created by economy? Is that just a mechanism to redistribute wealth?
",34627,"Not by itself. The inflation generally depends on the following monetary relation:

$$ MV =PY$$

Where M is money supply, V velocity of money (how much one buck is used in economy), P is the price level (change in which is inflation), and Y is a real output.

Now solving for P so we can focus on inflation gives us:

$$P=\frac{MV}{Y}$$

Hence price level (and consequently) increases when money supply increases, velocity of money increases or output decreases.

Now let’s analyze giving money to those unemployed.


Is it newly created money? If not then money supply won’t increase. If yes then it would increase inflation rate.
Redistribution generally does not affect velocity of money much so we can skip that.
Does this change the output Y? Well not by much those people are already unemployed. If anything it could increase Y as unemployed have probably high marginal propensity to consume so in short run redistribution from a richer person with lower marginal propensity to consume will increase Y. Especially if this spending was not paid out of higher taxes but from debt.


So a priori as long as it’s not financed through printing new money it should not really have effect on inflation. Inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.

Also, yes it’s a redistribution mechanism like most of the things that UK government does. Any policy that uses government funds as a transfer to others, or fund non-public good services (like NHS for example) is a redistributive measure.
",Accepted,"It seems you are not confused about part (1) because that's exactly what it means.

Lexicographic preferences are monotone. Monotonicity means more is better. If I have more of every good in the bundle, then I like that bundle more. This is still true for lexicographic preferences, even though parts of the bundle may not matter. A condition for monotonicity is e.g. that (5,4) is preferred to (3,1). In other words if 5>3 and 4>1 then the first bundle is preferred. This is true for lexicographic preferences.

Your definitions of strict monotonicity and lexicographic preferences seem to deviate a bit from conventional definitions though. Here is a proof using your definitions.

Proof:

Let us compare two bundles with $n$ elements each: $x=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2, ...,y_n)$

It is best to start with the if statement when going about proving such claims. The condition and therefore starting point is $x_1&gt;y_1$ and $x_2&gt;y_2$, .... , and $x_n&gt;y_n$.

In that case since  $x_1&gt;y_1$ we have according to your preference definition that bundle $x$ is preferred to bundle $y$. Furthermore we have that bundle $y$ is not preferred to bundle $x$. So bundle $x$ is strictly preferred.

Hence, we have shown that if $x_i$>$y_i$ for each $i$, then $x$ is preferred (because in that case $x_1 &gt; y_1$), which is your definition of monotonicity. The preferences are therefore monotonic.

On r/Economics, u/ComfortableCold9 asked


  From your point of view, at what point would we [the USA in 2020] be approaching weimar? A QE program of 15 trillion? 25 trillion?


Right under, u/Bumblewurth answered


  From my point of view, never. What made hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and (most other regimes with hyperinflation) was printing marks to pay debts in gold. The whole point of QE is to provide liquidity (already there) and to prevent deflation/meet inflation targets (not there yet.) If we're at QE with 25 trillion it's because we still haven't seen inflation in consumer prices.
  
  Inequality will be through the roof though as asset prices inflate.


u/Bumblewurth answers u/ComfortableCold9's follow-ups quoted in line.


  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] So seeing as we pay our debts in dollar, that suggests to me that we are effectively reliant on the dollar maintaining its strength
  
  
  [u/Bumblewurth :] No we aren't. If the dollar falls, the debts fall with the dollar. That's the difference between hyperinflationary economies in the past with non-sovereign debt and modern economies with sovereign debt. You aren't printing more dollars to chase the same amount of gold.
  
  
    But as soon as we start to see a level of inflation that would warrant a massive QT program, the economy would be held hostage.
  
  
  Economy is held hostage with deflation risk already. There's risk everywhere. That's life. But QE won't cause hyperinflation, just a whole lot of asset inflation and inequality.
  
  Most of this could be avoided if we weren't so tepid about using fiscal policy or if the fed had a fiscal tool to just send checks to everyone to manage deflation. Monetary policy is pushing on a string. But congress won't act, so here we are; Just like in 2008.



Like u/ComfortableCold9 below, I too ""don't see a difference""? 
I don't understand Bumblewurth's distinction between ""future obligations"" and ""current debts"". ""Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them"" — So what? 



  
    [u/ComfortableCold9 :] I don't see a difference here; if the dollar started to lose lose strength, you would have to print more dollars to get the same value of what you're buying.
  
  
  Yes, that's a concern for future obligations, not current debts. Current debts are wiped out when you monetize them. But once you get inflation you stop QE because the entire point of QE is to create inflation so that demand is at productive capacity. You aren't printing money to cover obligations and then printing ever more to cover the same obligations as your currency falls. You're printing more to prevent deflation. That's the point. QE and Weimar aren't related.

",35916,"If you want something ""even more ELI5"", try this from the Atlantic:


  Let me unpack these one by one. Right now getting the markets to buy our debt isn't the problem. Getting enough debt for the markets to buy is the problem. Investors are so crazy to load up on Treasuries that they're actually paying us to borrow, taking inflation into account. But while we're currently getting free money from investors, Hungary circa 1945 was getting no money. It was an investment pariah. If Hungary wanted to rebuild its economy, its only recourse was the printing press.    
  
  Second, the United States isn't really printing money. At least not like post-war Hungary. Quantitative easing is usually described as ""money-printing"" but it's not really. QE involves the Fed buying longer-term bonds from banks. It simply swaps one asset for another -- in this case, cash for longer-term bonds. Unlike Hungary, the Fed isn't directly paying the Treasury's bills. This is a hugely important distinction.
  
  Whatever money the Fed ""prints"" is stuck in the banks. That money isn't inflationary as long as the banks don't lend it out. What if the banks do start lending at a faster clip? The Fed can still effectively pay the banks not lend by, for example, raising the interest on excess reserves or require the banks to set aside more money. It would be shocking for the Fed not to pursue one of these options.
  
  Third, the most important difference between us and post-war Hungary or Weimar is that our roads haven't been razed to the ground and half the country isn't striking. It's very difficult to have hyperinflation when you still have a functioning economy. Almost all examples of hyperinflation result from huge economic shocks that devastate an economy so much that leaders think printing money is the only solution to growth. As bad as the Great Recession has been, our GDP is already back to and above its all-time pre-recession high. As bad as unemployment is, more than 80 percent of the labor force is working. In Zimbabwe, 80 percent of the population was unemployed.
  
  Let's conclude with a modest proposal for an economic corollary to Godwin's Law. The first person to reference Weimar's hyperinflation in an economic debate automatically loses.


Yeah, it was written in 2012... Nowadays there are some fears (time will tell if justified) that people returning from the lockdowns [when those end] will cause ""unexpected"" inflation. But that's a different story, not really about QE.

If the programs are devised effectively, hopefully that won’t be the case.”


Are these Reddit comments below correct? I edited r/economics.


  Let’s call it what it is, junk bonds. They don’t care about municipalities, this is buying up corporate garbage debt to bail out the rich. Corporate bonds was bad enough, junk bonds are straight garbage that WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RISKY so why is the Fed buying it. This is no benefit to Main St. at all. If your argument was the municipalities need to issue debt to function and this helps grease that market, the right answer is that municipalities that cannot clearly afford projects should not issue debt. Let’s be honest, boomers had so much money they threw it at high yield, enjoyed the gains but now it’s garbage so the taxpayer is bailing them out.
  
  This is the end of capitalism and free markets. You could argue that a few banks were too big to fail, maybe they should have. Now you are talking about 100’s of companies like Best Buy and Macy’s that we’re already doing bad so we are throwing cash at them in the form of loans and also bailing out their debt to people who shouldn't have bought it. Don’t forget how much these CEOs and boards make.
  
  I hate to be political but let’s remember T[ARP] actually made money, it was risky but the QE was limited in amount and by assets that were “good”. Look at the group of individuals in charge now and their financial history, the idea that the Fed will get its money back is an absolute joke.
  
  Junk bonds are junk because they are risky.
  By definition they don't deserve to be saved by the government.
  
  Its purpose is to place cash on the balance sheets of organizations that invest in securities like junk bonds in the hopes that they will wake up and see credit risk and roll the cash into the stock market to bolster the President's re-election chances.
  
  [Source] Buying junk bonds is stupid - these shitty companies are all getting free money from the fed while at the same time laying off and furloughing millions of workers. Banks and other people with money then buy up ownership in these companies that won’t fail (arguably many should), benefiting from rising stock prices while the companies pay out no wages to workers. It’s all fake and will prop up the wealthy people who own businesses and leave the rest of America in line for food stamps. There is no reason for this insane rally in stock prices when upwards of 10 million Americans are unemployed.

",35945,"This is primarily to allow nationalisation of shale oil.
",Accepted,"The payment of interest is straightforward. The central bank is a bank, and pays interests on deposits in exactly the same way as any other bank.

If the central bank wants to pay $1 in interest to a depositor, it:


increases the amount on deposit by \$1 and
reduces the central bank's equity by $1.


That is, it just reshuffles the right hand side of the central bank's balance sheet; the asset side is unchanged. (On the income statement, there is a correpsonding $1 interest expense.)

All the central bank needs to do is ensure that the aggregate interest paid on reserves is less than the aggregate interest received from its lending and bond/bill holdings to prevent equity from going negative.

Since 100% of a central bank's assets pay interest, and its currency (dollar bills) do not, keeping the net interest flow positive is not too difficult (in a positive interest rate environment).

You asked what backs the currency. The answer is the taxing power of government. There's a few theoretical justifications for that statement, One is provided by Fiscal Theory of the Price Level (edge of mainstream), and another is referred to as ""neo-Chartalism"" (post-Keynesian).

As for the relationship between inflation and the rate of interest, the answer depends upon which school of economics you follow. Increasing interest rates increases the interest income of the private sector (which should increase effective demand, as you note), which is traded off by the effect on behaviour of the higher rate of interest. The conventional answer is that the behavioural effects dominate; that is, higher interest rates slow the economy and inflation.

5297,34628,Why does global suspension of economic activity result in catastrophic loss/debt?,"Covid-19 has forced a suspension of at least 50% of financial transactions and business activities. 

Materially, not much has been lost: consumables have been spared, equipment is dormant, maintenance is mostly inexpensive. Why is the health crisis expected to bankrupt many businesses? Is most of the loss speculative?

Propery tax + land rental = 20-25% of yearly rent, so a landlord can waive rent for 6 months and still make profit! enough to pay 2 years of tax and maintenance. 

I naively imagine that using government moratoriums on bank-debt-interest rates and fees, It is possible for companies to organize a state of dormancy and maintenance for an extended period, without incurring significant loss. 

Can you give a summary of why it is not so simple, and why the losses are a lot worse than a financial and material dormancy? 
",34630,"It creates losses. 

First, many businesses don’t own their own building/land/equipment. It’s very common to lease these things. Moreover, many business take out insurance that again has to be paid on monthly basis. In Europe in many countries you need to pay workers certain portion of wages even when you can’t call worker to work or even if they stay home sick. 

The list here is not exclusive. The point is many business have non-trivial fixed costs that have to be payed whether business operates or it doesn’t. Furthermore, in short run even some variable costs - like wages to employees on production line are fixed (and in many countries this can be up to several months). Hence, it’s not like a dormant business have no costs. 

You might ask why then we don’t suspend for example these leases etc. but that just moves the problem to the different parties and does not eliminate this issue. 

Moreover, very large business might have enough financial cushion to absorb losses for few months, but there are many small-medium size business that can’t do that. For example, consider a sole trader (a form of business organization where one person embodies a business) who has a repair shop with no employees just living month to month. That kind of businessman can not afford to go on hiatus for very long.

Furthermore, if by long you mean not just weeks but several months or even year that would be issue even for the best cushioned business.

So yes the impact could be catastrophic. For example according to this VOX blog the impact under some scenarios could be worse than recent 2008 crisis.


",Reasonable,"You may want to look at the literature of the effects of taxation on savings. A survey is given in: Sandmo. A. (1985) The effects of taxation on savings and risk-taking, in: Auerbach &amp; Feldstein, Handbook of Public Economics, Elsevier.

In this survey, the (simpler) problem of the overall effect of taxation on saving behavior is analyzed. A change in tax progression is much more subtle and harder to measure.

The survey states the problems associated with estimation of this simpler problem and the author comes to the conclusion that the empirical results are inconclusive. Since then there may have been some move in the literature, however.

5384,35797,How likely is a total economic collapse due to the potential coronavirus impact?,"Most signs show that lockdown could easily stretch through the summer. A freeze in consumer spending would cause multiple industries to fail causing a ripple effect.

To be specific, if lockdown lasts through the summer, and a second virus wave occurs in the fall as expected, then lockdowns will continue further into the year. The timeframe for a vaccine is 12-18 months earliest. Then, the vaccine must be manufactured and distributed. Since the virus is so widespread that it is now assumed that it will reach a global critical mass, this essentially guarantees the collapse of the restaurant, airline, tourism, and hotel industries as they cannot sustain prolonged losses in a capitalistic structure. If they fail, their suppliers fail, and so on. History has shown that large systems are prone to failure time and time again, esp. when accountability is obfuscated (e.g. the Titanic, the World Wars/Holocaust, and now this). In the past Egypt fell, and then Rome fell. What is to say our current systems won’t fail, even if as a slowly sinking ship?

EDIT: This question was closed, before I received enough good, thoughtful answers. As of tonight (April 4th) Bernie Sanders held a virtual address on the situation. He's looking at the unemployment projections that were posted by the St. Louis Fed's models and has spoken with a number of economists. Finally a voice of reason in this media circus. He has confirmed that a potential collapse is possible as another 47 million Americans may become jobless - this is unprecedented and would be absolutely devastating to American civilization.
",35809,"As a disclaimer, this is not an answer, rather a long-form explanation of the difficulties of answering.

The first leg is uncertainty about the danger of the epidemic. Economists are not medical experts. For example, one could imagine that there is an amazing breakthrough where a common medicine saves patients. The economic effects of that scenario are very different than the scenarios presented by governments. More realistically, we do not know how strong activity restrictions have to be to control the epidemic.

The next leg of uncertainty is the government response. Governments have the capacity to bail out entities (firms, households) that get in trouble. We do not know what they will do.

Even if we knew all that, there is uncertainty about the best model that takes all this in. It is very unusual for governments to restrict economic activity in such a broad-based manner, and so there are no standard models. (There is a flood of research.)

Finally, “conventional” economics does not really spend much time looking into societal collapse scenarios. There are areas of academia that do this, and there is presumably studies in economic history. Experts in those subject areas are not normally visiting this website.

5405,35861,How does the Federal Reserve unwind the asset purchasing scheme announced in response to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic?,"On Monday, 06 April, 2020 the Financial Times reported that the Federal Reserve balance sheet could increase to $9 trillion.  This is partly due to the myriad of initiatives, some new, to protect the economy of the United States during the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.  

A lot of online commentary is alarmist and centres on the threat of hyperinflation and many of the news articles don't inform the reader how the Federal Reserve purchases assets.. This puts the average citizen at a disadvantage when understanding the economic impact.  

My question is multi-faceted (but singlular) and aiming to focus purely on the economics.


How does the Federal Reserve unwind the positions on their books?  Do financial services have to purchase the assets back at a later date and does the Federal Reserve charge a premium for the service?
Can a position of this size (60% of national output) actually be unwound?


If this question is similar to the approaches of other Central Banks then please tag accordingly if appropriate.  
",35864,"The unwind depends upon what the central bank did.


If the central bank did a repurchase agreement (“repo”) or lent against assets for a fixed time, the agreement automatically unwinds at the term of the deal (which is short). They would need to enter into new deals to keep their balance sheet size unchanged.
If they bought the asset outright, it will either mature, or the central bank can sell ahead of maturity.


There are no “charging a premium” involved; the cost of the operation is embedded in the lending cost (or purchase/sales price of an asset).

There was a very large debate about unwinding central bank balance sheets in the 2010-2016 (?) period. The Fed was eventually able to slowly reduce the size of its balance sheet in the last cycle, and there is no reason to believe that this time is different. There is no sign that an “unwind” was necessary, nor are the effects of unwinding a deep concern.
",Reasonable,"You can visually inspect for heteroscedasticity in the disturbances by plotting the regression residuals against the fitted values and then checking if you can discern some pattern to the spread of the residuals in the scatterplot. The idea here is that the variance (spread) of heteroscedastic errors $\varepsilon_i$, conditional on the explanatory variables $X_i$, is not constant:

$$ Var(\varepsilon_i | X_i) \neq \sigma^2.$$

You can also explicitly test for heteroscedasticity in a linear regression by using statistical tests such as Breusch-Pagan or White.

Can any human/doctor for example, say this patient has 60% chance of being a cancer and 40 % chance of not  being a cancer?
