6326,41752,Gyms nationawide are closed due to COVID-19. What is the best way to continue training for a powerlifting competition?,"Across all of Canada, all GoodLife gyms, Fit4Less gyms, university gyms, and presumably other gyms are closed, and for a long time.

I am training for a powerlifting competition and do not have my own 20kg bar and certainly don't have 200kg worth of plates to continue practising deadlifts and squats.

What is the best way to continue making progress on strength for deadlifts and squats?
",41768,"I'm sorry, but realistically, you can't.

That being said, if you look at the range of different ""fitness"" qualities (endurance, power, strength, flexibility, etc), strength is generally the last one to go, and it's also one of the easiest to get back once you've initially built it.

There are some things you can try, there is going to be some carry over from bodyweight exercises to the traditional powerlifts (though obviously not as much as training the lifts). Things like dips and pull ups to strengthen the triceps and back. You can do core work because a stronger core is always a good thing. Pistol squats, while not the same as a loaded barbell squat, will allow you to keep training your legs.

Also, now is the perfect time to address all those little niggles and flexibility issues that you've been ignoring. That tight hip, the knee that aches if you keep it in the same position too long, the shoulder that's a little wonky, everything like that.

Fingers crossed, by fixing the little bits and throwing in some bodyweight stuff now, you'll be able to come back stronger (figuratively speaking) when you're able to get back to training.
",Reasonable,"Anything more strenuous than a long hike is detrimental to totally orthodox, full-focus-on-strength-and-size Starting Strength. However, I've found that daily (or less frequent) yoga is a great supplement to powerlifting.

If you're capable of all the exercises in the program, there's no particular need for additional stretching. I've found that the exercises themselves provide a moderate degree of mobility work. I've also found that many people, particularly the un-athletic, are incapable of performing at least one of the lifts without specific stretching, mobility work, and copious warm-up.

6327,41756,Used to Do StrongLifts But Now Have to Work-Out at Home due to COVID-19,"Over the past several weeks, I have been gaining muscle mass and getting close to PRs across the 5 lifts specified in the Strong Lift Program. Now, many gyms are closed across the United States (and the world) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What exercises do you recommend that I could do at home and most closely simulates the Strong Lifts 5 x 5 program? For, when the quarantine is over, I don't want to lose my progress in StrongLifts. 

Thanks!
",41757,"Unfortunately, unless you have a good home gym set up, you aren't going to be able to carry on with the StrongLifts program.

Sorry, but that's just the way it is.

Now, focusing on the positive, there are a large number of home training options available, depending on what you're willing to invest in and what space you have available.

I like kettlebells, so I own a few of them and can get a good training session in with swings, Turkish get-ups, presses, goblet squats and loaded carries.

Likewise, bodyweight, you can get a good session in with press ups (since you mentioned you've got bad wrists, you can invest in some push up handles, or can you do push ups on your dumbbells?), pull ups, single leg squat variations, planks and Romanian deadlifts using a box full of books (ok, it's not bodyweight, but you get the idea).

Being outside in nature is always a good thing, so load up a backpack with some weight and go for a walk (technically called ""rucking""). While you're at it, occasionally press the bag overhead, or carry it one side or the other, bear hug it to your chest, just play with the position to stress your muscles.

If you've only been training for a few weeks, chances are that you'll still gain strength from any sort of training, provided you don't slack off. No, it won't be StrongLifts style training, but stronger is stronger, having a solid core is always a good thing and helps with the powerlifts. Basically, improvise!
",Reasonable,"How can I avoid such feelings while still studying well and not gaining a lot weight?

Well, studying also use calories. With that said, instead of consuming more food, try drinking more water to fill you up. Sometimes, its not hunger. Since you mention lack of energy and have some headache, try taking a break once in a awhile by taking a short nap, taking a slow walk and etc.

Is it because of enjoyment (sad or at least normal non-excited people don't like too much eating) or it is because math is harder?

Whenever I enjoy doing something, I tend to forget about eating. If I don't enjoy doing something such as preparing for examinations, I tend to eat more.

1295,39689,How to get 5-year-old to consistently cover mouth when couging?,"My 5-year-old son started developing a dry cough yesterday (yay...).  He has trouble remembering to cover his mouth when he coughs, despite our reminding him every time he does it, and despite in the past during extended illnesses him finally catching on after our repeating reminders.

Given the possibility of COVID-19 being the cough source, we want to extra make sure the cause of his cough is spread as little through the house as possible.  Is there a way to quickly and effectively get him in the habit of covering his mouth the moment he feels a cough or sneeze coming on?
",39690,"Getting someone into the habit of doing anything requires repetition, as that is what a habit is largely: a settled or regular tendency or practice.  

The best way to establish a habit in a child from my experience is to gently remind them to do the habitual action immediately after the ""cue"" for the action.  In this case, it would be to:


Hear your child cough
If they didn't cover: Remind them to cover their mouth
Praise them for covering their mouth


The praise is appropriate either if they did cover their mouth, or if they didn't but they covered their mouth when you told them to (yes, this is pointless, but it establishes the habit).  

There are some more rigorous explanations of this method, such as here; that site goes into some detail about the relationship between ""cue"", ""routine"", and ""reward"".  

It's not something that will happen instantly, but it does work over time.  The key is not to be upset when they fail - don't be negative about it at all.  Just be positive.  Polite reminder to do the action (don't forget to cover your mouth!), praise for doing it (good job covering your mouth), and then repeat!
",Accepted,"Don't talk - just act:

Every time the child is coughing without hiding his face in the elbow - not covering the face with the hand, because the virus can be spread by hand shake and then having contact with hands in the face (nose, mouth openings)  - you can order quarantine in the children room.

If you don't act like this your child and yourself and the whole nation will be in a shut down and national quarantine sooner as you think. And then you will have time for discussions and explanations. (And then the children and all others too will be habit.) 

If we were in a war the authorities would activate the sirens now. This is not the time of apocalyptics but it is the only chance to stop the spreading of this virus and to keep the hospital beds free for people who need it. 

The other alternative would be that everyone has to cough with open mouth that all are infected as soon as possible with probably thousands of deaths. When everyone is infected the virus can't spread any more.

Edit 1:

We all know that it - covering the face, but not with the hand - should work like an unconditioned reflex. But at it is not unconditioned it has to be conditioned.  There are 2 ways: 


reinforcement of the goal behavior (that’s what Joe describes)
or negative consequences = “punishment” of the wrong behavior  (the alternative we don’t prefer)


Edit 2:

My answer 3 days ago was a time out in his room every time the child forgets to cover his face. 3 days we are at the point that all children, coughing are not, can‘t see their grand parents for weeks. And people elder than 65 years are asked to stay inside. A week ago we still were shopping and met young mothers with 4 children in the super market running around. Meanwhile this is forbidden and teenagers are punished if they are in groups outside. Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria ...

Children are not victims of this virus but they can be infected and spread and there is no time to loose! No time to wait for developing habits. Also in the USA they will be isolated or walk around with a mask.

Edit 3:

After the discussion about “praise” vs. “punishment” (s.comments below) I’ve edited  “punishment” = negative consequences. OP clearly says that he has remembered the child (5 years!). He should have learnt it with 3 years. 

Btw. I’d like to emphasize that I wrote “wrong” behavior and not “bad”. Unfortunately “punishment” and “praise” is always associated with good and bad. Consequences should be logical (positive or negative).

It is clear that children - and adults! with naive stereotypes  consider negative consequences = punishment. (Look at the religions: negative consequences lacking of hygiene are interpreted as punishment of the gods. Same problem we have with our bad! dealing and habits with our environment and animals.)

1296,39703,How would you explain COVID-19 lockdown to a 4 year old?,"How would you explain COVID-19 lockdown to a 4 year old given that the lockdown might be in place for months in London?
",39704,"First of all, recognize that your concerns may not be the same as your four year old's concerns. This has two implications:


Your child may be worried about things you couldn't have thought of. Your child is likely shielded from or doesn't understand a lot of what's going on, and that can also mean that they don't have access to bits of information that would actually be reassuring. Encourage your child to ask questions about corona, so that they're not left to ponder on their own things that may seem frightening.
You are likely worrying about outcomes your child has no thought of. Try not to pass on your own fears to your child. If pre-school is closed and one parent has to stay home from work to care for the child, recognize that this may be viewed as a mainly positive outcome to the child.


With my three year old, I emphasize that all closures and restrictions (writing from Sweden, we're not currently in full lockdown) are not - ultimately - to protect us from disease, but to protect our elderly from catching it from us. I find that framing to be appealing because it's both true, and I imagine it's less scary to a young child to hear how we all have to chip in and make sacrifices to protect another group, than to convey an image that it's actually unsafe for them to step outside.

Why we should wash our hands and what's so good about vaccines are some things we talk about normally, and the current situation is a good opportunity to put that into context. You can say that it is to avoid this that we vaccinate against a lot of other things, and that scientists are working on a vaccine against this too. That perhaps once your kid will have children of their own, and they will receive a corona vaccine as well in the routine program, and your child will be able to tell their children how they remember what it was like before the vaccine. Washing hands has been a constant battle. Now we've introduced a longer routine, which involves singing a 20-second-long song, and compliance has (temporarily, I assume) increased.

Consider whether you are changing your own behavior in a manner which may require explanation. For instance, if you are suddenly buying groceries in conspicuously larger quantities than normal, or even if they may have seen the images of empty shelves, you may want to point out that you and others are trying to reduce your number of trips to the grocery store, and hence the number of chances you may infect some at-risk person, lest they think that you're actually going to run out of food.

As an adult, it's easy to become consumed by this. We like to stay updated about what's going on in the world, and this is certainly a main event, and a rapidly evolving one. For my own sake, I could easily bingewatch news for the greater part of the day, and spend the remainder hypothesizing over different future scenarios. Recognize that a young child's world is smaller than yours. Talk about it as a thing that's happening right now, but make sure most of your interactions revolve around normal day to day activities. The above is addressing your question, how to talk about corona, but also make sure you don't talk exclusively about corona.
",Accepted,"This should not be a problem at all. The person likely to suffer from Zika id the person traveling to affected areas.

Zika may cause microcephaly in fetuses, that is, while the baby is in utero. Once the baby has been born, it can't contract a birth defect per se. It can contract the illness, but not enough is known to say the illness would be any different in infants than adults (in other words, like any other run-of-the-mill viral illness, not like a dangerous one, say Hepatitis B or C.) Some people testing positive for the virus experience Guillain-Barré syndrome.

The virus is most commonly spread by mosquitoes; it can also be spread through sexual contact, but no other mode of transmission from person to person is known. Even if your mother-in-law is sick from the virus, she can't give it to your baby. If a mosquito were to bite an infected person (your MIL, say) while they are sick, then bite your infant, the virus may be transmitted in this way, but think about the odds (they are quite small.) 

The illness usually lasts about a week, but is mild enough that many don't even realize they have been infected.

There is still a lot that is not known about the virus. If you need to take the absolute safest measures to be comfortable, knowing that


  The incubation period (the time from exposure to symptoms) for Zika virus disease is not known, but is likely to be a few days to a week.


and


  During the first week of infection, Zika virus can be found in the blood and passed from an infected person to a mosquito through mosquito bites


Then, if your mother-in-law is not sick on her return, a week should be time enough for a viral infection to declare itself, then another week to run it's course.

I in particular use the ""MAP Recommended Practice"" feature with my son, who is a fairly advanced math student.  You can enter their test scores in, and based on those test scores it recommends the next lessons for them to take to ensure appropriate subject matter and difficulty.

I have been offering my children 2 hours of Khan Academy per day, plus 1 hour of reading, 1 hour of practice programming (using Scratch or Python), and 1 hour of more gamified learning (such as Prodigy, which is basically Pokémon but with math problems needing to be solved in order to do damage to your opponent!).

4088,39685,"How to ask a child what's wrong, without suggesting things to worry about?","So tonight at bedtime, my child was wanting someone to stay with them (until they fell asleep). We have had a busy few days so maybe they were just wanting some quality time. 

However I am a little concerned that they may be feeling unsettled. Given COVID-19 we have been encouraging them to wash their hands more often and properly, and to make sure they catch their cough in their elbow. Explaining that people can get sick if (we all) don't do that. This made them think they were sick.

So tonight I wanted to ask if they were feeling ok. But I didn't want to give them any leading prompts, in case I projected that worry onto them. I tried asking why they wanted mummy or daddy to stay next to them and they answered 'Because I want you to stay next to me'. Hmmm a tautology. Technically true but not very useful. 

Are there any techniques which are useful to tease out if and why a child may be unsettled, without suggesting something that is not there they then may absorb and think they should be worried about?
",39686,"A child that I am close to (7) has had some events in her life that made her a bit closed off, but she loves to draw so her mother taught her to express herself through drawing. 

She asked her to draw how she feels each day, and from the reoccurring themes she was able to see that on the days she seemed sad she often drew herself alone and the drawings often had darker/blueish colors, and on the happier days lighter colors with red and yellow surrounded by either friends or family. From which she kinda concluded that her kid was afraid to be alone (this was shortly after her divorce). It also helped her discovered that she was afraid of wasps/bees because she heard people who are allergic can die from a sting. 

It's probably not a fast solution to your problem but maybe you can trick your kid in to telling what is wrong by letting them draw about their feelings/day. After a few days you might spot a recurring theme that you can tackle.

They also aren't very noisy (some cats are very noisy), and they're fairly passive aggressive about attention. I'm not saying that it will absolutely work for you, because it depends on the person as well as the cat. My aunt has a kitten who's a little hellion on speed, but plenty of cats are calm.

4089,39701,How to protect my children from abusive mother?,"I am looking for some urgent advice with how to proceed. My wife is constantly emotionally and physically abusive to both my 3 and 5-year-old. She belittles both, plays favorites, talks about her impending death, threatens them with all manner of scary stories and regularly slaps then on the head or back with an open palm.

I am convinced she has a personality disorder including OCD and NPD (I suggested therapy and was told to f-off). She has been drunk while they are in her care on many occasions as well.

She is currently a stay-at-home mum, however, we have had a maid since the eldest was born who bathed and fed them, and now I work from home and do most of the cleaning etc.. She is simply a person who wants to continue her life undisturbed by kids, she still has her Friday night (though they can be a midweek one as well) blow-outs, coming home blind drunk and vomiting like clockwork.

I am scared to leave her with the kids as she is extremely lax when it comes to safety. We live on the 38th floor and she has left the balcony door open many times, and now she is not bothered about closing the baby gate and letting the boys run free in the kitchen. Her latest act has been to go clubbing and drinking in pubs during this coronavirus outbreak without taking any precautions and coming home completely wasted. (BTW we live in Hong Kong).

I am writing this from a coffee shop as I have been forced out by her gal pals who are over for drinks. I have endured this for 18 yrs now. I want to get advice on how I can proceed? Do I simply rock up at the CPA and tell them the situation? Why would they believe me? How to prove this? I would give her everything as long as I can care for the boys.

Any evidence you can get will be very useful. The maid may be able to support what you say, depending on how open your wife is with her mistreatment of the kids. I'd also suggest trying to get some video or audio recordings, but you should look into whether these can be used in court if the other person is not aware that they are being recorded.

4115,39769,How to minimize covid-19 exposure child visitation with the non-custodial parent?,"What practical approaches are recommended or possible to minimize covid-19 exposure during child visitation, weekend visit, with the non-custodial parent?  Are there medical or legal guidelines on this topic?  (I live in Georgia, in the USA.)
",39770,"First: we are not able to answer legal questions, so don't take this as really addressing the legal side of things.  Look up those details in your area specifically or ask a lawyer for that.

In general, visitation is likely still possible currently.  See this advice from Nolo:


  How do Social Distancing Rules Affect Custody Arrangements?
  
  
    The social distancing and shelter-in-place rules don't directly affect custody orders, so you should continue following your current custody arrangement unless you and your ex agree to an alternative plan or a judge changes your custody order.
    
    Courts are making it clear that disobeying court orders or withholding visitation during this time won't be tolerated and may result in contempt of court. But if you have valid concerns about your child's health and safety, you can try communicating with your ex to see what you can both do to reduce the risks to your child.
    
    Within a family unit, creating an effective social distancing plan can be as simple as adopting rules for parents and children to follow within their home. But for divorced or separated parents, social distancing and staying healthy when children are going back and forth between two households can be challenging.
  


An example of a state issuing guidance on this is Delaware:


  To be clear, neither the State of Emergency nor the Seventh Modification interferes with or invalidates any existing Family Court order regarding custody or visitation. Custody and visitation orders remain in full force and effect. Travel (including interstate travel) for the purposes of complying with a Family Court order is considered essential travel and permitted. Such travel was deemed essential in Governor Carney’s Fifth Modification to the COVID-19 State of Emergency Declaration issued March 22, 2020. Under the Seventh Modification, such travel remains essential and is excluded from the selfquarantine requirement. 


CNN indicates that some states have more vague language, however:


  Other states have left rulings vague. In Massachusetts, for example, John D. Casey, chief justice of probate and family court, last week issued an open letter that said, ""both parents should cooperate.""


Some states are apparently encouraging (but not requiring) virtual visitation, such as Vermont:


  How is the Department for Children and Families dealing with social distancing?
  
  
    According to Johnson, DCF has called its families to ask if they would be willing to have virtual visitations.
  


That all said: you should consider the risks that visitation would bring.  If your child, or anyone in either household, is in the 'high risk' category, for example a child who is immunocompromised due to medication, or an elderly parent living at home with the family, it may be appropriate to limit or eliminate in person visitation.  That would depend on an agreement between the two parents, though, to modify the arrangements temporarily; it would not be automatic.

It is highly recommended to have a conversation with your ex-partner, and be clear about your concerns and open to creative ideas.  It may be safer to have fewer handoffs for longer periods of time - if it is normally 5 days / 2 days, then perhaps 3 weeks / 1 week is possible, for example, if the normally noncustodial parent is not working or is working at home and able to spend time with the child.  The linked CNN article above has more recommendations along these lines.  

Facetime/Skype/Zoom/etc. are good options for maintaining contact with the child without personal contact.  Many activities can take place over videochat; reading a book to them, playing a board game virtually (one person moves pieces for the other player of course; or some games, like Battleship, can be played completely remotely); online games, of course, as well.  
",Reasonable,"If your child has a subject they are really interested in and you can build something related to that subject from the Lego that you already have, then you can use the second hand Lego Technic to your advantage.

See if you can locate an image and possibly a building description of the item that interests your child and then create your own (overcomplete?) set of Lego in a box of your own design.

That way, you have turned your second-hand Lego sets into something unique and if your child asks why the gift wasn't bought in a store/in a box from Lego, then your answer can be that it doesn't even exist in the store. That unique is the gift.

And remember, opening the box on something new can only be done once. After that, it would be the same as opening the box on a re-packaged second-hand item, even if the toy was brand new the day before.

3313,115220,What is a likely cause of this glow in my photos?,"I have been using a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 100-400 zoom for wildlife photography. It's admittedly a budget setup (in some sense of the term ""budget""), so I don't expect amazing results. I'm also not a trained photographer, and I've pretty much learned by reading the internet and youtube (not ideal, I know). Recently, I decided to rent a different Nikon body for an expedition (which ultimately got canceled due to COVID-19).

I decided to rent a mirrorless Nikon Z6 to see how I would like a mirrorless camera, and to try a full-frame sensor, and also just to get a newer sensor and body and see how the quality compares, using the same Tamron lens.

I made a lot of mistakes in using the new body, but ultimately I'm stumped still. The photos are displaying the same annoying glow that I've seen with the old body. I don't know what is causing it, but it seems like I can narrow it down to ""operator"" or lens errors.



In the image above, a heavily cropped section of a photo of a bird, you can see the glow. It shows up similarly using either body. This is shot at 400mm, ISO 320 f/6.3, 1/500 sec. 

I handhold the camera most of the time because I just can't use a tripod for most of these photos (the birds are up in a tree, jumping around, etc.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for what I should do here? Should I use faster shutter speed and higher ISO? I've tried that and found that I get a lot of noise, but maybe the newer sensors can handle it? I'd be willing to spend some $$ on a book or read any references people might recommend. 

Thanks!

EDIT
This image is uncorrected, straight out of the camera, though (sadly) I took it as a JPG originally. I usually shoot raw, but had my settings incorrect for this new body that I'm renting. I see the same effect whether it's RAW or JPG though, it was just that this photo showed the effect more strongly so that I could illustrate my question.

Many lenses ""glow"" when used wide open, especially in bright light with high contrast. It is likely associated with spherical aberration and is typically reduced or completely gone when the aperture is closed a stop or two. Increased familiarity with the lens' behavior and characteristics will allow you to predict when the glow will and won't be present. You will then be able to select apertures to match your artistic intent.

For personal, but more advanced use you might consider getting a personal budgeting / personal finance software, like YNAB or Moneydance.

If you are just starting a new life somewhere I'd highly suggest to start using one of them, so you can track your spendings, and get a better idea of the real living cost of your new home.

See https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F19315.

It's not clear to me why they would care about the proof of your whereabouts, but there is a requirement to apply for the card within 90 days of your arrival in France.  If you apply after 90 days, the cost rises from €25 to €340.  If you apply within 90 days but they drag their feet, the cost should remain €25, so, because you moved in October and applied in October, you should be paying the lower fee.  There is no other penalty for a late application; in particular, you cannot be deported.

You write:


  We traveled inside Europe from the time we arrived in the summer of 2015 until we moved into our new house in France in October of 2016 (15 months). I did not secure a residency permit anywhere, because we were staying with friends and didn't really have a permanent residence. Perhaps I should have applied for the CDS when we signed for the house in January 2016, even though we really weren't staying in France for extended periods. Just trying to find out if it's going be surmountable after all this time.


Yes, it will be surmountable.  As mentioned, the only real question is whether to charge you €25 or €340.  I do not know exactly what criteria they would use to assert that you owe the higher fee, however.  If you were never in France for more than 90 days, then they probably cannot charge the higher fee.  If you were in France for more than 90 days, uninterrupted, before filing your application, then they certainly can charge you the higher fee.  If you were in France for more than 90 days, and then left, and then moved to France, they might argue that the higher fee is due, and although I doubt that this would stand up in court, the cost of a court battle is not justified by the €315 difference.

The 90 day period is triggered by your arrival in France, not your purchase of property.  If you were based in France for your 15-month travels in Europe, then you should arguably have applied for the card then; a short trip away from France would generally be held not to interrupt your period of residence.  On the other hand, if you were in France for just a few days, but spent most of your time in Germany or indeed anywhere else in the world, it would be difficult to argue that you had established yourself in France at that point or that your period of residence should be said to have started then.  In any event, their interest in your whereabouts seems consistent with an inquiry into whether to charge the higher fee, but whether that is the real reason or not is still unclear.

It seems, however, that your major worry is whether they can deny the carte de séjour altogether.  In general, they cannot.

More precisely, they can deny it only on very limited grounds, which almost certainly do not apply.  The grounds are:


Your husband is not an EU citizen
Your marriage to your husband is not valid
You and your husband, as ""economically inactive"" people, are not able to support yourselves
You or your husband are a danger to public health
You or your husband are a danger to public safety
Your or your husband's presence in France is contrary to public policy


The third item, being able to support yourselves, is only necessary for the first five years; after that time, you gain a right of permanent residence in France.

People are being told not to travel unless it is essential. Frankly at this time noone knows how the situation will have developed by August.
",Reasonable,"The previous green card can be deemed void because she will be presumed to have abandoned it because she was away for more than a year without a reentry permit. The social security number however is valid for life.

Nevertheless, if she enters using her green card the worst the immigration officer can do is refer her to immigration court. They cannot turn her away. It is only an immigration judge who has that authority to declare definitively that the permanent residence was abandoned

Note that the determination of abandonment by the immigration officer at the airport is discretionary. There is no defined time period after which when a person is away they are determined to have definitely abandoned residence. They are presumed to have abandoned after one year away however if they can provide evidence to show it was out of their control, the immigration judge can make a ruling that they did not intend to abandon it and hence reinstate it.

I personally know someone who returned after almost two years and was let in. The immigration officer didn’t even interrogate in-depth why he was away almost two years. He never filed the reentry permit document to protect his residency or got an SB-1.

In this case I don’t think you want to drag your child through immigration court just to save $1500 or so. Additionally the 5 years absence was prolonged so prospects of winning in immigration court are low.

The problem however is even though she has a nonimmigrant visa, if she enters using the visa she can be turned away at the airport if they dig a little because they can reasonably assume she has immigrant intent and that she is only coming on the visa for convenience and you will file for her when she arrives. That will cause major problems for you. Also remember you will have to wait some months after she arrives before filing for her because of the 90 day rule.


  90-Day Rule
  
  Although USCIS has not updated their Policy Manual with a similar
  rule, adjustment of status applicants would be prudent to assume the
  same guideline is in place. For example, many attorneys are now
  advising their clients to avoid marriage and adjustment of status
  within at least the first 90 days of entry.


CONCLUSION


She should formally abandon the permanent residence, then enter on the visa. If questioned she will have to say she’s only visiting her parents. Then 91 days later, you can file a new permanent residence application for her.
Alternatively you can let her wait in India while you petition her from scratch and not use the nonimmigrant visa because technically it would be fraudulent to enter with a nonimmigrant visa knowing full well you are going to adjust status.

I am French, living in Spain and my boyfriend is American living in NYC. He has his own business with his brother and before we met they already wanted to expand the business (creams and body care oils) to Europe. 

He wanted to hire a person to be in charge of all the translation work, calls, emails and European marketing in general for Europe. I don't want to go to the US, I am fine here in Spain but we found it stupid to hire someone to do this job when I am actually a teacher and translator here in Spain. So the plan would be to go there for a year to help them get into European business, teach them a bit of Spanish and French so they can travel (they already are in touch with potential clients) and get to know the products etc. being at the stores they have. After all this, the idea is to come back before next summer as I plan to open my little language school and he plans to open another store here in Spain.

Can he hire me even if I am his girlfriend? Nothing is official we are neither married nor pareja de hecho as we call it here. If he puts an offer online and present my resume etc for H1B visa, in the case to be approved (which I doubt with all this Corona virus thing), am I able to tell the embassy he is my boyfriend ? I mean I don't want to lie and I don't think it is an option actually, and as I really don't wanna live in the US neither...

Short term training should cover getting to know the products. Discussing marketing strategy would be consulting with business associates.

Translations and marketing can be done from anywhere in the world. Calls and e-mails are best done from the correspondents' timezone or close to it, so being in Europe would be an advantage. To promptly return a 9 a.m. call from someone in France you would need get up very early in New York.

You would not be allowed to teach your boyfriend and his brother while visiting the US, but you could teach remotely and you could travel with them whenever they are in Europe to translate, smooth their way, and teach them the languages. As time goes on you do less talking and translating, until they can do business in Europe without you and you can get on with starting your school.

",Reasonable,"Summary

Currently there are no real negatives to gaining Irish Citizenship, other than:


The cost and hassle of registration on the foreign births register.
The Cost of your first passport.
Renewal fees for your passport renewals on expiry every 10 years.


Background

According to The Wikipedia article on The Irish Diaspora there are about 3 million people living outside of Ireland with Irish citizenship.

Additionally, the Irish Times indicates that up to 6 million people in Britain could be eligible for Irish Citizenship. (The actual number may be lower.)

Given that Ireland has only 4.7 million residents in the country, they have great infrastructure for supporting citizens abroad. 

To answer your specific questions:


There has never been conscription to the Irish military, other than when enforced by the British. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Ireland for more history.
You will only need to register for tax if you're resident/ordinarily resident/domiciled in Ireland. http://irishabroad.com/Irish-World/Expats/Moving-to-Ireland/Working/taxation/ has more information.
If you do have to register for tax in Ireland, it has an extensive network of Tax Treaties that would stop double taxation: http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/tax-treaties.html has more information.


Areas which may need investigation


I'm unsure of the implications for inheritance tax. I expect that since neither you nor your family would be resident in Ireland it wouldn't be relevant.
You might have some complications if you buy Irish Funds, stocks, property, or open bank accounts there. They could have specific rules that cover your situation. However, if you are ""just a citizen"" but have no other real relationship with the financial/property system you should not have to register with the Irish tax system at all.

",105999,"Absolutely there is a way to propagate yeast, it's as simple as making a starter with it. Most of the time these days people create starters for sourdough using natural yeasts, but you can use them to feed any kind of yeast. All you would do is put flour and water in a container with some yeast, let it get to work and once you start to get bubbles put it in the fridge to slow it down. You would then use half of it for every batch of bread you make, replacing the flour and water to keep it at the same quantity. 

If you don't use any of it for a few days you'd want to throw half away and refill in order to give the yeast a fresh supply of food. You can share this with as many people as you like, just split it into two, give each a fresh supply of flour and water, and repeat as many times as necessary. Using this technique a small amount of yeast could theoretically supply the entire planet.

I have kids who like their food white. My usual method for BSCBs of a reasonable size is a quick brine and bake, pound them a bit and steam in a covered skillet, or just boil 'em (I know, it's sad). Will these monsters turn out okay if I treat them this way? 

Secondarily, if I were going to cook something with actual flavors, what would you recommend?
",107231,"It really depends on what types of meals you plan to make with them.

If you would typically serve people a whole breast, then I'd cut each one down into more reasonable sizes (slice vaguely across the grain ... I usually start at the more bulbous end and slice diagonally through it so I end up with a chunk that's mostly from the thin end)

For the size you're starting with, you might want to cut each one into 4 to 6 pieces.  If you're planning on pounding them, I might even go with 8 to 10 pieces.

Once they're a more reasonable size, you can then brine and bake them or pound them out, them like you normally would.

As you mention boiling them ... I would recommended poaching them instead.  If you cut them up first, go with my original recommendation of an hour.  If they went in whole, I might give it two hours.

If the prices do drop within the next 3 years, is it reasonable to expect that I would be able to get the same kind of loan I am eligible for getting now from a bank?

2773,120858,"If a broad long-term investment in the stock market is such a good deal, why don't banks do the ""obvious"" things?","There is a fundamental discrepancy or paradox that has been keeping myself, and many others, away from the stock market. Before I explain it, let me mention some selected popular questions on this site in which the consensus is that in the long term a broad investment in the stock market will yield a substantially positive average annual return rate:

Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?

Why do people claim that Stock Markets are broadly exponential in the long term?

Why isn't everybody rich?

Stock market long term risks

Is it a lie that you can easily make money passively in the stock market?

Are Index Funds really as good as “experts” claim?

In view of all this consensus, we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy. More precisely, the consensus seems to be that there is some average annual return rate, say 3% (replace this number by something higher/lower if you prefer), such that if your investment is diversified enough and your timespan is long enough, the risk that your actual average annual return rate drops below that rate tends towards zero.

Now comes the first question: Why doesn't any (serious) bank offer a savings account with a fixed 2% interest rate for an unlimited amount of time? 

After all, a large bank has the optimal prerequisites for diversification and holding stocks for many decades, and if the above is true, then they would still earn at least 1% of their customer's account values each year by essentially doing not very much except buying and selling some index funds according to what customers want to withdraw or pay in. 

My own first objection to the question would be the following: If there is a market crash and at the same time a lot of customers want to withdraw money from their accounts, the bank might be in big trouble because the total value of the stocks owned by the bank could be less than what the customers want to withdraw.

However, I feel that this is not really an objection because even without the above ""obvious product"" banks will always be in trouble if their customers want to withdraw too much money at once. 

What's bothering me even more is the

Second question: Why don't all banks borrow a huge amount of money from the central bank and invest it in the stock market on a broad, long-term basis? 

As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates (much less than the expected long-term average annual return rate of the broad stock market), in Europe that interest rate is currently even negative. So why don't all banks just buy index funds using this free money and just hold them forever, watching them grow in value?



Edit: After the first few answers (and some downvotes) I immediately realized that it was a big mistake to specialize the question in the sense that I only asked why banks don't do the ""obvious"" things, rather than having simply asked why no-one or  no specialized company does the ""obvious"" things.

Thank you all for your answers and upvotes, earning me a gold badge with my very first question on this site! If one could only trade in those badges for their real world counterparts... ;-)
",120859,"Fundamentally, I think there's a high level (and perhaps unsatisfying) answer to this. It's because that's not ""banking"" as a business, and a bank is established to do banking, not to get into the stock market. In other words, this question strikes me about the same as asking,


  why don't ice cream shops stop selling ice cream, and instead get in the business of selling pancakes? After all, you can make a lot of money selling pancakes.


Well yes, you can get rich selling pancakes, but not every business is a pancake shop. Certainly, some businesses get rich selling pancakes, but other businesses with different motivations and risk tolerances decide to sell ice cream instead.

To make this clear in your banking context: such a business would essentially be called a hedge fund or investment management company, not a bank. It's fine if a company wants to be a hedge fund, but a company that is calling itself a bank can't secretly switch over to being a hedge fund, and still call itself a bank while supporting ""banking"" activities for normal consumers.

From a more practical perspective, most jurisdictions have carefully developed regulations that would essentially prohibit a business calling itself a bank from doing what you're discussing. Essentially, these regulations exist because of my first point - the business model you're describing isn't ""banking."" And, regulations are designed around that, in the sense that regulations keep banks acting like banks and stop them from trying to act like something that isn't a bank.

I'm editing to clarify a portion of your question, as an example of this disconnect. You said,


  As far as I know, banks can borrow money from the central bank at quite low interest rates


That's not really the whole story. Think of it this way. Imagine if you were to walk into a retail bank right now, and ask for a loan for a million dollars. The bank would certainly ask you some questions, including asking what you intended to do with that money and how you could show proof that you are able to pay it back. If you were able to prove that you have a large and stable income, and that you were planning on using the million dollars to purchase a home that's actually worth a million dollars, you might get approved. But what if you told the bank, ""I'm actually empty handed, but I'm going to go invest this in the stock market, I think I have a proven way to make a positive return"" - they might deny you on the spot, or at least they might have a lot more questions for you!

The relationship between central banks and retail banks is fundamentally similar. A retail bank can't just call up the central bank and say, ""please wire me a billion dollars"" and instantly, the money shows up. Retail banks essentially have to go through a process of validating their operational intentions, showing proof that they can pay the loan back, and perhaps even putting up collateral, before the money changes hands. And, a retail bank with no collateral who indicated that they wanted to play the stock market would almost certainly get turned down by the central bank.

I'm making another edit to address another core flaw in your assumptions. You said,


  we can almost say that it has become ""common knowledge"" that investing in the broad stock market (sufficient diversification) on a long term perspective (several decades) is a very good investment strategy


While that may be a sound theory it's not a practical method for a bank to keep or invest assets, because of liquidity and predictability. It may be accurate to say that ""in the long term"" a diversified stock portfolio can be bulletproof. But banks can't issue cash to deposit customers based on long term theories. They have to be able to predict the availability of funds very well - the stability of their outcomes, not just the expected result. In other words, if a bank has $10 billion in assets, they need to know precisely how much of that will be available to them tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or in six months. Your stock market theory may have the right expected outcome (positive growth), but it's got far too much potential variance on any particular day. Yes, ""in the long run"" you may make money, but can you tell me exactly how much cash you'll have next Tuesday? No, you can't. You might have an acceptable expected outcome on Average for all ""next Tuesdays"" - but what if coronavirus takes off in the US this weekend? Or something else happens? Banks aren't just concerned about the expected outcome, they're also concerned about variability in the range of expected outcomes. People do ""banking activities"" like deposit their paycheck into a deposit account, or take out a credit card loan, with the expectation of stability and availability of funds. Those ""features"" which are essentially the definition of retail banking come as a trade off in terms of a slightly lower return (compared to your stock market portfolio).

No. The simple reason why is that even if you buy immediately when the market opens, that's still too late.

As an example, imagine that there's a single ETF which trades both in the United States (from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm US Eastern time) and in Great Britain (from 4:30 am to 11:00 am US Eastern time).

Now let's imagine that it's 4:30 am Eastern, and the ETF begins trading at $80. However, the price of the ETF increases over the course of the day, so that by 9:25 am Eastern, the price of the ETF is $100.

Can you take advantage of this by buying shares of the ETF in the United States immediately upon open? No, because when it starts trading in the United States, it will start trading at about $100, not at $80. You'll be paying $100 for shares worth $100, which is, of course, a profit of $0.

Maybe you're thinking that when the market opens, the opening price is the same as the previous day's closing price. This is not the case. The market won't open at $80 and then immediately rise to $100; it will simply open at $100.

3202,121579,Buy apartment now despite corona crisis?,"I am about to buy an apartment (in a major city in central Europe) to live in, mostly with borrowed capital (around 80%). The price was set before the financial crisis due to the corona virus started. Should I change my plans? Is there any possibility of saying whether the crisis also had an impact on the real estate prices so far? My personal situation is stable in the sense that my job is rather safe despite the crisis. Should I continue to buy the apartment as planned?

Note: I am aware that the future cannot be predicted, what I want to find out is the following: Since the price for ""my"" apartment was set before the corona crisis started, is there already any evidence that the real estate prices in major cities in central Europe have taken a hit? I.e. I am not asking about the future development but rather about a comparison of the situation before the corona crisis to the present situation. 
It would also be interesting whether in the past the stock market was correlated with the real estate prices, particularly during / after crises.
",121618,"It's unlikely that you would be able to have firm evidence of a sudden drop in price so rapidly. Reason for that is that the real estate market is a bit peculiar: Transactions take time to put together and it can take a long time for prices to adjust. The real estate market is not nearly as liquid as the stock market, international commodity markets or flower auctions.

When there is a real estate crash, it's common for the number of transactions to drop while buyers and sellers figure out the new price. Sellers, especially individuals who have a lot invested in their house, a (possibly underwater) mortgage to pay back, etc. are not ready to lower their asking price at once. Some might prefer to sell their house for the same price several years later rather than selling it at its real price right now. Buyers who are concerned about paying too much (like yourself) wait for the price to feel more reasonable relative to everything else. Those who need to sell a house before buying another one might also be stuck. And nobody knows exactly where the market might clear in between.

But, right now, you would not expect many real estate transactions to be happening in Europe. Real estate agencies are forced to close in several countries, it's not possible to visit houses, etc. So it's difficult to have any idea of what the current prices are, whether the drop in the number of transactions reflects a drop in the underlying market or is just a side-effect of the current measures to fight the pandemic, or how fast everything is going to go back to normal.

mostly with borrowed capital (around 80%)


This is too high in my opinion. There has been a period in history in Amsterdam when real house prices fell 80%, leaving only 20% (source). True, it happened over a period of 37 years (1778-1815). Shorter term crashes are usually more limited, easily leaving 50% of the house price value left. If you pay your loan back quickly, you could fund more than 50% of your house with borrowed capital. 60%? Definitely. 70%? Maybe if you pay your loan back very quickly. But I would not fund 80% with borrowed capital.


Is there any possibility of saying whether the crisis will have an impact on the real estate prices?


Anything is possible. In particular, investments (real estate, bonds, stocks) tend to be correlated. We now know that stock yields have increased and equivalently prices have reduced. Whether the same happens to real estate prices is anyone's guess.


Should I continue to buy the apartment as planned?


You should note that alternative investment options have reduced in value and increased in yield. For example, a major hydropower/nuclear power producing company in my area has a dividend yield of 8%. Add to that 2% of inflation, and you have 10% nominal yield. (It only distributes some of the earnings back as dividend, so part of it is reinvested, so the nominal yield could even exceed 10%).

So, do a quick calculation. How much yield would a stock investment have? How much yield would a real estate investment have (in avoided rental costs)? Take into account all estimated maintenance a real estate investment would have in a period of 50-100 years.

I can't say definite yes or no, but in the area where I live, the answer is a clear no. House prices would need to fall by a huge amount to make living in an owner-occupied house profitable, when considering alternative investments (stocks).

The danger in selling is that you may be following the pattern of many casual investors: fear of missing out drives them to buy stocks when the market is very strong and then fear of losing all drives them to sell when the market is very weak. They end up ""buying high and selling low"" which is a guaranteed way to lose money. 

On the other hand, if you do need the money in the near term, you pretty much have to accept the loss and sell. Whether you should sell now or a month from now is probably not answerable by anybody without a crystal ball.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the market has just received a solid wallop of information that a bunch of companies are not going to make nearly as much money this year as they thought they were. Some companies may experience a cash flow crisis that bankrupts them. If you own individual stocks and have the analysis skills, you might review your holdings and try to figure out if any of the companies you hold are in danger of going under. If your retirement is in index funds that you don't need for a few years, then I'd suggest sitting tight.

Furthermore, the price reported for a stock is the last price at which the stock was sold. If demand for the stock were to fall to 0, there would simply be no liquidity (no shares of the stock bought or sold), but the share price would still be reported at whatever the last transaction price was.

I believe one of the CNBC hosts was touting this idea this morning.  A simple way to refute one of the underlying notions here is thus: If you don't like what you see then just go ahead and close your eyes, and the bad thing will go away right?  Of course not.

You might say ""Maybe the market just doesn't know what stocks are worth right now and that's why the market is down.""  I'd answer  that no one ever really knows exactly what a business/stock is worth (some exceptions aside).  Generally, people who sell think it's worth less than the price and people who buy think it's worth more, so why do we need to shut the market?  

You might say ""Maybe not everyone feels comfortable trading or feels like they know what this specific business/stock is worth right now so that's why we should halt trading.""  I'd answer with why can't the people that do want to trade continue trading and if you don't know/ just aren't ""comfortable"" then step aside, no one is forced to trade (unless maybe they used leverage/need the money).  

The punchline on extended market holidays, reiterated: Except in cases of traders or technology used to trade actually being unavailable/overtaxed for some reason, it's something we should avoid at all costs.  There are lots of negatives, and I'm not aware of any positives outside of the corner cases mentioned above.

A surprise trading halt as you mentioned of an extended variety is one of the worst things that can be done to a market.  Imagine...


Surprise! That thing you owned that you thought was liquid and you could buy or sell on most days Monday-Friday, excepting holidays, actually isn't!  And if you need to raise money between now and the market re-opening, tough! 
When the market does re-open, going forward, everything in that market should be priced more cheaply in one respect, and that is to account for a new illiquidity premium that has been introduced to the market.  All else equal, if you could own the same stock on two exchanges and one had random extended trading halts while the other didn't, there should be a disparity in the pricing, albeit not massive, between the two.  I'd rather own the one that trades more frequently.  Illiquidity in an asset is not a good thing.  
Just because something isn't trading and its price stays the same doesn't mean its value is not changing, it just means that it's harder to estimate(no one can truly see it) that true value.  It's quite possible that when the market reopened some of the companies would be worthless.  See the bullet two down on the economy for more info here. 
It's harder for everyone to deal in securities that have random extended halts because of those halts, which hurts liquidity even further going forward.  Less liquidity is bad.
The rest of the economy would continue to function, but not as well as it would with the market open.  So many transactions happen in the market on a daily basis and while some of these are retail or professional investors trading in the market, many of these trades are transactions where one company is hedging their exposure to another company.  Or, just using the market to see a gauge of the health of their counterparty to determine if they're going to engage in a business transaction and if so at what level with what other terms.  Imagine one company is buying components from another.  Each will look at the markets to judge the health of the other in their negotiations.  Without functioning markets, that process gets more difficult and it is exponentially more difficult at times of stress when companies are worried about the health of other companies.  That is when it is most important for markets to be open.  If markets are not, distrust reigns and activity/deals between companies grind to a halt.  That harms the economy.
Closing the market doesn't allow companies to think longer term.  Closing the market causes everyone to speculate which companies are in credit trouble and won't be around.  Others seek to limit or avoid exposure to the firms that might be failing by cancelling orders and halting shipments. Just the rumor that someone is in trouble will cause others to stop dealing with that firm and then it really is over for the company in question.  If the market was open that didn't have to happen.
The ""chaos"" you describe is simply the process of price discovery in times of uncertain economic outlook.  The market is volatile, it is what it is.  Instead of wondering what companies are likely worth for the next two months we can let them trade and have a best estimate.  That's what the market is, an estimating machine for the value of businesses. 
Those values are very important to businesses as they do business with each other.  The stock market is not some pure speculation machine/ random number generator that pushes values around willy-nilly.    
Think of it this way: Maybe I don't like when prices change so we should just have stocks trade once a year, then everyone can really ""plan long term?""  That sounds ludicrous right?  It's the same idea.
The world is a scarier place, companies are making less, businesses are hurting, people are dying and stocks are worth less as a result.  Closing our eyes won't make the situation any better.  Restricting trade by closing the market would hurt the underlying economy.  Trade is generally a pretty good thing.

",Accepted,"The simple reason is that they don't need and can't use liquidity; they know when they expect their foreign currency denominated cashflows will fall (within a reasonable range of dates) so they buy futures with the intention of taking delivery at maturity. OK that's not entirely true because the futures normally deliver financially rather than as an FX trade but the maths shows that the outcome is equivalent.

One other key thing to consider is that the company wants to lock in the exchange rate in the future, at the time when the cashflow occurs, rather than the current exchange rate. It doesn't matter (much) whether that rate is better or worse than spot, it is the rate they need to make their exchange at.

So, what the companies are doing is hedging the exchange rate that their future cashflows will be exchanged at rather than hedging the exchange rate at the current time but there is another, linked, reason why they don't make the exchange at spot in the current period; they don't actually have the cash to do so right now. These future cashflows have not been realised yet so they literally don't have the cash to spare now to convert to or from a different currency to complete the trade that you are suggesting. They will only have the cash available at the date when the exchange needs to be done so how can they use that cash in the current period?

Therefore, banks are legally limited in what they can do with it while you're entrusting it to them. Yes, the bank does lend that money to other depositors, putting it at some risk, but they are heavily regulated on how they do that. Ideally, since you can never lose your deposit, the bank isn't allowed to lose it either. Deposit accounts are guaranteed (up to $250,000) by the FDIC, which has regulatory power over commercial deposit banks and can preemptively shut down or otherwise intervene to ensure banks can make good on their deposits.

Investment (brokerage) accounts, on the other hand, are for the purpose of purchasing (possibly risky) investments that can potentially lose money. Any investments you make, you're on your own. The bank is only required to prohibit you from doing a few specific things thay are very risky and/or stupid. The ""cash"" portion of your investment account is money that the bank can use to purchase it's own (possibly risky) investments. Although they have a fiduciary requirement to protect your money, this is not the same thing as a guarantee. Investment banks are insured by the SIPC, but unlike the FDIC, it has no regulatory power and does not insure the actual value of your investments.

In short, banks have much more flexibility with investment money than they do with deposit money. This is why you have to do a transfer before you can invest.

The reason things are this way is because of some very shady activities that banks were engaging in during the Great Depression, and during the subprime mortgage crisis.

3277,121769,With reserve requirements eliminated what reason banks have to not approve every loan?,"Quoting wikipedia:


  On March 16, 2020, amid an economic crisis caused by the 2020
  coronavirus pandemic, for the first time since the inception of the
  Federal Reserve, the fractional reserve requirement was reduced to
  0%.[11]


Now question is why would banks not approve a loan? Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.

note:for simplification this assumes that cost of processing a loan is 0% for bank, we know that realistically they need to pay their employees.
",121772,"
  Worst case they get 0 $ back, but that does not mean that they lost money since credit was created out of thin air so even if every credit defaults they still will not loose any money and anything they get back is pure profit.


Obviously if a bank never lost money by not getting paid back they would make loans all day long, even ones they knew they would not get paid back on.

But the fact of the matter is, a bank's profits are based on how much they actually make on the loan beyond the cost of the loan itself.  The cost of the loan includes the principle which must be paid back.   What you refer to as being created ""out of thin air"" doesn't mean that money is being created from nothing, it is referring to the fact that the same money can be loaned out multiple times, effectively creating what appears to be actual money several times in excess of the actual amount of money floating around.

Another way of looking at it is that a bank generally isn't lending its own money.  They get the money from other sources and lend it out at higher rates than they pay, and from the excess the pay their expenses and hopefully have some profits left over.  So if you put $100 in an account at the bank, the bank can lend that $100 out and earn interest on the money, but at the end of the day, they still owe you $100 on demand whenever you ask for it.  The ""created out of thin air"" comes from the fact that the person who lends the money will need to put the money somewhere, most likely either the same or a different bank, or if they use the money to pay somebody else, that person most likely will deposit the same money in the bank, so ultimately, most of the money they lend out stays in the banking system where it can be lent out again.

The fractional reserve requirement just states how much of that money can be lent out again in the aggregate.  A 0% reserve requirement basically means the bank can lend it all out again.  It doesn't mean that they will be able to (only so much money in loans is being sought at any given time) nor does it reduce the fiduciary requirements to make good loans that are likely to get paid back.

3280,121820,Calculations Check on $SPY Strangle,"I'm researching options strategies and I started paper trading a $SPY options. Here's my strategy:

Set up a strangle 5% above and below the market price expiring a month from the day of trade. 12 contracts total. 

On Feb 20th, I looked at the cost of that setup:

Actual price of the stock ($SPY) = $336.40
Sell a Call 5% above the market (SPY200320C00355000) = $0.13 x 100 x 12 = + $156.00
Sell a Put 5% below the market (SPY200320P00319000) = $1.42 x 100 x 12 = + $1,704.00
So on Feb 20th, I would have received $1,860.00 for selling those options.


A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)

On Mar 20th, I would have to pay back

Current price of the stock ($SPY) = $244.41
SPY200320C00355000 is now worth $0.01 = $12
SPY200320P00319000 is now worth $77.10 = $92,520.00


leaving me with a total of $ -90,660.00

Although it is clear that this strategy backfired given the current situation, I would like to understand if my calculations are right. 

More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400

Since starting, I learned that an Iron Condor is much more secure than a Strangle and I'm planning to paper trade that strategy for a while.
",121822,"I think there's a few things you may be misunderstanding about selling a strangle. 

First: 


  A month later, the idea is that one of those options would be worthless and the other one cheaper than the price paid (of course this was not the case with the current market/Covid-19)


The ideal scenario behind selling a strangle is that both options expire OTM, as they were OTM when you sold them to begin with (in your example, on February 20th). This would result in you keeping all of the premium you initially received, the $1860.00 (not including commissions associated w/ selling these options, which can vary depending on your account, but we'll assume no commissions for the sake of the theoretical scenario). 

Second part: 


  More specifically, do I have to consider the fact that for every point that an index option goes beyond the strike, I will have to pay/earn $100? If this is the case, I would have to pay an additional 9,200 per contract (?), or $110,400


One, SPY isn't an index and if you wanted to sell options on an index, you could simply sell them on $SPX. Two, I think you're neglecting the fact that movements in the underlying are not the only factor that affects the value of an option, you also have time, and volatility (in a simplified sense) that affect the value of the option you sold. So you can't simply just use this rule of thumb without taking these into account, unless you're saying you are only concerned with what the price the option is on the day of expiration. In this scenario, then yes you'd be only concerned with the difference between the underlying, and the strike price of your option. 

So regarding the 319 Put that was sold at $1.42 a contract, then on the day of expiration (March 20th) this put would be worth $74.59 a contract, and in your example, this could either get exercised against you (if you let it) and in that case, you'd have to buy 100 * 12 = 1200 shares of SPY at $319.00 which would cost: 

$319.00 * 1200 = $382,800 and then your position is actually currently worth $244.41 * 1200 = $293,292 so your loss would be: 

$(293,292 - 382,800) + $1860 = $-87,648 (recall the $1860 in premium you received initially)

Or more commonly, you would have to buy back the option to close out the contract (since you sold to open the contract), which would cost: $74.59 * 100 * 12 = $89,508. Note that the call would expire OTM (worthless) and you don't have to buy it back. But, recall that you initially received $1,860.00 in premium when you sold these two contracts, so your total loss is: $87,648.

",121898,"This is a question on the minds of just about everyone in the FX markets right now.  Unfortunately, there is no great answer.  It's sort of like asking if stocks are going to go up or down.  I'll list here the three big things that will determine the value of the USD in the medium term.  There are many others but I believe these to be the big ones.

(1) The decrease in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus should be strongly deflationary.  This can increase the amount of stuff that a dollar can buy because there isn't as much demand for the stuff.  So effectively the dollar strengthens.

(2) A flight to safety during time of stress where the USD is generally considered the safest currency.  The dollar has generally been strengthening against other currencies.  Part of this strengthening has been related though to the fact that a lot of borrowing happens in USD and when you borrow USD and then lose money you have to pay back the USD that you lost.  This has meant dollar buying, which has certainly contributed to the recent dollar strength.

(3) Stimulus/relief efforts on the part of the federal gov't to counteract the economic effects of the virus mean more debt to GDP.  Giving people money to spend like this in inflationary, which should reduce the value of the dollar.  The more debt you have relative to your ability to pay, then the more those lending to you should theoretically charge you in interest because you are a riskier borrower and less likely to make good on all of your payments. 

So we have two deflationary effects and one large inflationary effect.  The depth and length of the crisis will determine how much dollar ""strength""* we see from #1 and #2, and the gov't response to the depth and breadth of the crisis will determine #3.  They're intertwined.

*Here strength is relative to the price of goods and used in the deflationary sense of strength.

3362,122034,Deciding on a correct down payment for a house,"I am in the process of making an offer for a house. Wife and I have about 135K saved, with steady jobs, both happen to be an 'essential business' as required for this period during the corona virus.

Initially, I wanted to put 20% down (about 74K) to avoid PMI and have lower monthly payments.

I have since reversed course on this. I think 10% (about 37K) is better, and here is my reasoning. PMI calculators online suggest the PMI will be about 150 a month. 37K invested returns should be more than double the yearly PMI payments during an average year. We plan on being in this house for the foreseeable future, so I am playing the long game with this chunk of investment. We can also have the option to make a chunk payment in the future to bring it to 20% equity and get the PMI taken off if we choose. Also, this gives us access to this cash in a more liquid form during these unsure times.

Does this reasoning make sense? With a long term outlook, would it still be wise to sink the extra 37K into the house and get rid of the PMI?
",122037,"Short answer: 
It probably makes sense to avoid the PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but it ultimately depends on how probable it is that you are unable to pay the monthly installments with/without the extra savings. 

Long answer:
While i am not an expert on the specifics of the US mortgage market (I presume the question pertains to US), it seems that a PMI (or an increment of the overall interest rate charged on the loan) varies between 0.5% and 2% p.a. and is charged on the overall loan amount (90% in this case). Your loan amount works out to 333k from the provided information and your annual PMI payment to 1800. This puts it on the lower end with 0.54%. 

That means that with the 37k you plan to invest instead of paying down, you have to earn 4.9% p.a. plus the normal mortgage interest rate on those 37k - all this net of tax (assuming you get no tax deduction on your mortgage/PMI payments). This seems like a tall order compared to a ""risk-free"" savings you realize by having a lower mortgage interest rate on the overall loan amount without the PMI. So based on risk/return considerations alone, you are probably better off avoiding the PMI. Only a very low PMI rate would result a different outcome from that perspective.

Another consideration to make is whether putting the 37k aside instead of using them for a down payment would improve your worst-case scenario and could buy you additional time in case you have difficulties repaying the mortgage. Only you can figure out how much this ""option"" is worth, considering how secure your and your spouse's incomes are, what are you going to do with the 61k that remain even if you choose to pay down  and how much the monthly mortgage repayment is, compared to your income. Based on the information you provided, it seems that the 61k can last you for a significant period of mortgage repayments, so that the value of any additional cushion is probably very small.

The problem with this idea of information being priced-in is that we all know there's a global pandemic, but there are very different opinions about how much that should affect the market.

Consider unemployment levels: We have projections about unemployment rate potentially hitting a peak over 30%. Meanwhile, the current unemployment rate is 4.4% and projected to hit double digits in April. The only way all of that information could be appropriately priced in is if everyone agreed about the reasonableness of the projections and had the economic prowess to understand the actual impact of those figures.

Instead, what happens is that some people will see the actual April unemployment numbers as surprising new information to react to, while others will see it as old information in line with their expectations. Add in thousands of other pieces of information about which people have conflicting opinions, and it becomes pretty much impossible to know in advance if that information was all priced in appropriately.

I've got an automatic contribution for my health savings account. The balance grows and grows. We've barely had a chance to spend any of it, aside from dental expenses.

Are there guidelines about how much one should aim to set aside for medical expenses? Are there actuarial figures about what medical expenses are likely to be, over a given period? (Obviously any of us could come down with a horrible chronic disease at any time, and drain the account. The ultimate decision will be balancing risk and opportunity cost, but as it stands I don't have any information about the risk.)
",123514,"There are few different things to consider:


Deductible : Since you have an HSA you are probably on a High Deductible insurance plan. Take a look at your HSA balance and divide by your max out of pocket deductible. That's the number of years you are covered for the ""worst case"" scenario. I'd say you want at least ten, but 100 years would be excessive. Depends of course on you own risk comfort.
Retirement : health care cost will likely be the single largest expense in retirement and unfortunately it's the hardest to predict and find good data on. A recent fidelity study put the average life time out-of-pocket cost for a couple into the $300.000 range. Other studies quote about $5000-$7000 in today's dollar per year per person on Medicare. Health Care inflation is currently significantly higher than regular inflation, which complicates the math further. Still, it's not unreasonable to have several hundred thousand dollars squirreled away for retirement health care
Coronavirus and shifts in the Health Care system: This is pure speculation at this point, but chances are that the current crisis will have an impact on the way Health Care works and gets paid for in the future. The most drastic change would be a single payer system (as many other countries in the civilized world already have) but it's very hard to predict how an HSA would roll over into this. One of the more plausible scenarios would be to allow a roll over into an IRA but that's all a wild guess at the moment. 
In any case the current system is stretched thin already. The average retiree  spends more than  40% of their social security income on health care and it is getting worse quickly.
Investment: HSA contributions are pre-tax money. In most cases that alone will outweigh any potential investment return. Assuming there is no high interest debt, I would recommend to first max out pre-tax retirement contributions, then pre-tax college savings and then pre-tax HSA. If you have other highly attractive investment vehicle you can consider those too. Stocks are cheap at the moment, although very risky and likely to be volatile for a while.

",Reasonable,"Sure it's possible. First of all, the MSCI World Index consists of over 1,600 securities, so it's unlikely that either fund holds all of them in the same proportions as the index. They likely hold a representative sample that is intended to track the index closely. So the funds could have significantly different holdings and could perform differently (better or worse) than their benchmark (this is called ""tracking error"").

One thing to look at is their historical returns and risk to see if one has performed better than the other in the past. This does not guarantee that it will be better in the future, but it might indicate a better selection process (or could just be luck).

That said, you'd have to have a LOT of tracking error to make a significant difference between the two. More than likely the difference is negligible.

USA shale oil wells won't cease to exist just because its not profitable to drill new ones. Shutting them in for now will actually mean they flow better when the oil price recovers. Do the Saudis realize they are no longer the world's swing producer? That is now the USA. Shale wells do not take long to drill and put into production once it is again profitable to do so.

Should I rather put some of that money to paying down more of the principal of the car loan , and pay auto insurance monthly increments as there is no interest associated with this?  I have an open-ended loan and I can pay lump sum payments towards principal at any time.

I'm also slightly worried about potential cash flow issues due to economic disruption of Covid-19.

If your policy has such a discount, it may make sense to pre-pay the insurance instead.

If you do choose to make a lump sum payment on the car loan, it probably makes sense to actively communicate with your bank to make sure the payment is applied immediately to principal.

Now I'm wondering what to do with it. I don't really know much about investing, so I'm wondering what the most logical long-term move would be for me right now.


My bank currently has CDs from 6 months to 5 years, all at 0.75% interest.
But I've heard that investing in stock indexes is low risk over long periods of time. If I were to put this money in an index now (while the market is plummeting) would this be a smart way to start saving for retirement?
Or should I hold on to the cash and try to buy a rental property?
Or is there a fourth, smarter option?


Specific Goals [Edit]

I'm specifically looking for a low-risk, low-maintenance option that makes the most sense over a long period time (30 years-ish?). Stashing it away until retirement would be my first thought for the money, but I'm not sure if it might be smarter to keep it available just in case.

About me:

I'm in my 30s, living in the US. I don't own any property. I'm currently making below the poverty line, but I'm getting by. I have no debt. I have $2K in a savings account. I may be moving across the country for graduate school in a little over a year.
",121766,"If you don't expect to need the money for the next 30+ years, the best thing you can do is invest in the stock market.


The return on investment for CDs is abysmal.  They're only a good choice if you need absolute certainty that your investment won't lose value (or, won't lose value too quickly after adjusting for inflation).
Real estate is risky, particularly on the small scale.  A single stroke of bad luck can wipe out your entire investment.
The stock market is also risky, but unlike with real estate, you've got enough money to mitigate that risk by spreading your investment (eg. with a mutual fund, an index fund, or simply buying a wide variety of stocks).  Expect your investment to lose value in the near future -- the market is way down, but I don't think it's quite hit bottom yet, and long-term fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic will keep things unsettled for a year or more.

If you can do this persistently do this for say four times in one year, you will end up with $2 grand which is about to %10 return. Besides the money is not locked down with minimum risk possible. Then you have one year to think what to do with it.

6080,121808,"Why don't companies, whose share price plunged, reverse stock split to boost it?","COVID-19 has caused many large-caps' stocks to tumble like Spirit, Husky Energy ($2.75). Why don't they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices? Here are some benefits of unsplitting:


A high stock price can make the company look prestigious. E.g. A company trading at $1,000 per share will be perceived as more valuable even though the firm's market capitalization may be the same as a company whose shares trade at $50.
Share values mustn't fall too low! There have been cases where companies have split shares only to see the stock market dive, pushing shares below $10. Psychologically, this may turn off some shareholders, and in extreme cases, share prices may be too low for a company to be listed on an exchange. Companies will avoid splitting to protect themselves from this possibility. Doubtless large caps wouldn't fancy themselves dropping to being a penny stock!

",121813,"
  Why don't they reverse stock split to uplift their share prices?


Stock splits (and reverse-splits) are a zero-sum activity (minus what costs there are to actually implement the split). It's like trading 10 dimes for a dollar bill. The company is not worth any more or less after the fact. It used to be that a lower share price was desired since it would enable more investors that had to buy shares in 100-share lots. Nowadays, with index funds dominating the market, that benefit has largely gone away, which is why you see companies like Amazon and Apple decide not to split their shares that are worth hundreds or thousands of dollars per share. 

A reverse split may be required in order to stay listed on exchanges, but it often seen as a large negative signal, much like suspending a dividend. 

So companies have no financial incentive to split or reverse split, but often have behavioral incentives not to reverse split.
",Reasonable,"Maybe you are thinking of a buy-back?

It is another way to reduce the number of issued shares.

If a company has enough cash on hand, the company buys its shares back (but only from those who are wanting to sell).

If the share prices had fallen much below the book value, the company can actually increase the value of the remaining shares (and thus potentially the price)

Just by being a willing buyer it can prevent the share price from falling so far below the book value that it would be attractive to asset strippers.

The book value is pretty much the net asset value divided by the number of shares

6142,122004,UK First time buyer- offer accepted on house: Should I reduce offer due to coronavirus?,"I live &amp; work in the UK. A few weeks ago, I had a verbal offer accepted on a house (I am a first time buyer). I had initially offered a bit lower than the asking price, that offer was rejected, and I ended up offering the asking price- and asking the sellers to include some fixtures &amp; furnishings. This offer was accepted.

Since then, the coronavirus has broken out in the UK, and the markets have all dropped considerably (I was intending to put money saved in a Lifetime ISA toward the deposit- so this has obviously lost considerable value). Most things I've read are saying that we have no idea how long term the impact of the coronavirus will be on the financial markets, or whether it will impact the housing market in terms of house prices. Mortgage rates are already very low, so are unlikely to get any lower, particularly now that the Bank of England base rate has been dropped to 0.1%.

I'm unsure what to do regarding the offer I have put in on the house. I am not buying for any reason other than owning my own home, and to establish that for myself and my family. I am fortunate that my job is relatively secure- even if there were to be a recession, and even if I were to lose my job, I have a trade to fall back on which is still in a growth industry in the UK. My experience to date has been that it generally takes me between 1-2 months to apply, interview for &amp; receive an offer for a job.

So, given that I am not looking at the house for any reason other than to establish a home (i.e. it is not primarily a financial investment), should I contact the vendors to reduce my offer, given all the uncertainty going on at the moment?

If so, how would it be best to approach this, and how much should I reduce my offer by?
If not, why not?

Are there any other factors that I should be taking into consideration here?

",Reasonable,"6 months is generally assumed to be decent. Depends on where you live and how good your unemployment insurance situation is whether you can manage with less, but generally 3 months is a first and 6 months a second goal. This is real net living expenses.

Wealth groups really depends. I mean, your income is nice - but if you get wealthy you start getting income for example from rental. Which sort of does offset the need for emergency funds. Depending on where your wealth is, you may also have a lot of liquidity just somewhere around - not only for emergencies, but also because you want cash in case of a surprise chance to make money. There really is no good answer. None which is not too private or too showing offy.

Generally once you have your reserves, start building savings for whatever (retirement comes in). That may include buying YOUR house (or not, some people need mobility more than THOSE savings), but definitely putting money into stocks, real estate that generates income. Depending on your passive income you may replace your personal emergency funds with repair funds-  I can live, for example, from my rental income, albeit on a reduced level. But it means I do not really need 6 months living expenses. OTOH sometimes you need repairs/renovations, so there is a property emergency funds. And yes, those do not wait - becuase we talk of rental property. If something needs fixing, it needs fixing.

If you approach retirement or a financially oriented lifestyle, you likely want 3-5 years reserves on the bank. Stock market crashes can be nasty and you don't want to take money out. OTOH if your financial lifestyle is trading.... well. Depends on your career planning.

That you're less likely to be successful if you try to pursue both active and passive investing strategies.

But why is it a bad idea to combine both strategies?

For example with recent events, people are betting heavily against the S&amp;P500, as we're still in the beginning stages of the coronavirus pandemic as of this writing.
",122025,"
Common advice given is that if you decide to become an active or passive investor, you should stick with the choice you've made.


No you shouldn't. It is perfectly fine to supplement an active portfolio by passive index funds, or to supplement an index fund portfolio with several carefully chosen stocks.

What is bad advice is to buy lots of various active funds (leading to index returns, because there are so many of the active funds, without low costs of index investing). If you believe in active investing, you should select only a fund or at most two in the same market, having fund managers you can trust.

What is also bad advice is to buy quasi-active funds, funds that claim to be active but don't really take any active risk because the fund manager fears losing to the index return. In this case, too, you pay for active management but get passive returns.

Let me propose a case where you could supplement an index portfolio with some actively chosen stocks. If you, for example, like traveling a lot more than most people. Unfortunately, traveling uses oil, so it might be a good idea to buy stocks of oil companies. Traveling also requires aeroplanes, so it might be a good idea to buy aeroplane manufacturer stocks. You of course travel with an airline, so it might be a good idea to buy airliner stocks.

Or, if you drive a lot with an electric car. In this case, it might be a good idea to supplement your index portfolio with stocks of Tesla and electric utility companies, especially those that produce electricity with fixed cost structure like hydropower or nuclear power.

Let me also propose a case where you could supplement an active portfolio with some index funds: you run out of ideas. Simply said. You have so much money to invest but you can't find any companies where you would like to increase your ownership. In this case, it's perfectly fine to buy index funds. Or, you could hire a monkey to throw darts into a list of stocks to select new investments for you. But it's much simpler to buy index funds than to hire a dart-throwing monkey.

  How can I balance these two risks?


Risk is a tradeoff. A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) reduces risk but also reduces expected return. Since the market moves up more often than it moves down, statistically you're more likely to be better off investing the lump sum and letting it grow over time. 

Being better off investing regular amounts over time when you have a lump sum ready to invest would be a result of luck, not skill (unless you know something that the market doesn't already know).

Is there any reason why the banks are buying their own shares at a crisis like this? 
",122041,"Assume there is a corporation that makes spoons, with $10M in cash. Its single factory is already pumping out as many spoons as it can. There is also no need to open a new factory, because our market research team has determined that no one will buy the new spoons from the new factory. Our R&amp;D team doesn't know how to make anything but spoons.

So, what does the company do with the cash? It could (1) sit on it, and earn basically nothing. Or it could (2) invest it in something completely unrelated to the spoon business. Or, it could (3) send it back to the shareholders. Let's look at each option:

(1) If the company just keeps the cash in the bank account, then it will earn basically no interest, and the investors who own shares in the corporation will be unhappy to get such little returns on corporate assets. If they wanted to have a low-risk cash portfolio, they would do that with their own money, they wouldn't want their spoon-making-investment to make that decision for them.

(2) If the company invests in non-spoon related things, then perhaps it will get into trouble by making foolish business decisions. Buying a fork-making factory could lead to trouble - why what if our spoon scientists forget to make the tines, and just makes the whole thing rounded, based on what worked for them in spoon making?? Again, if a company steps outside of its area of expertise, it is deciding, on behalf of its shareholders, to diversify its portfolio. But the shareholders could make that decision themselves, and doesn't necessarily want the corporation to make this decision. Note that some companies do successfully diversify, but it is typically part of an overarching plan that makes sense together, or else it often fails.

(3) If the company returns the cash to the shareholders they can decide for themselves what to do with the cash. Some will invest in low-risk things like government bonds or simple savings accounts earning minimal interest. Some will invest in competing spoon-makers, and some might invest in new fork-making ventures. But the decision on how to invest goes back to the individual shareholders.

Buying back stock is just one way to get money back to shareholders. The other common way would be to pay out a dividend. In financial theory, there are basically 3 differences between a share buy-back and a dividend: (A) A buyback is optional, meaning only the shareholders looking to sell their shares, will have shares bought by the company; (B) A buyback happens relative to the current share price in the market, meaning that part of the decision to make a buyback could be based on whether the company believes itself to be undervalued; and (C) the tax implications are different [In general, most countries tax capital gains on selling your shares, at a lower rate than corporate dividends].

So, why would a bank do a share buyback right now? Probably because interest rates are at a historic low, meaning that the bank has a limited ability to invest its capital to earn what it feels are good returns. So instead, it is leaving the choice to its shareholders how to invest - and because the bank probably feels its shares are undervalued, it is preferential to do this instead of paying a dividend. For the shareholders who remain in the company, the increase in share price is an indication that the decision made by the bank was one that benefited them.

Quick note on the political aspect hinted at here: The main reason it is contentious to do a share buy-back in times like this, is that a government could give a stimulus package to a business, with the goal of having that business invest in itself, hire workers, etc.; if instead of investing in itself it just pays out the cash to shareholders, the government has effectively 'bailed out' the relatively wealthy individuals who own shares, rather than the working class who they were attempting to get jobs for.

You can do this because you already have an emergency fund, and you believe your job is secure. If you didn't have the emergency fund you would send the extra amount there. If you were worried about your job you wouldn't want to tie up money you might need soon. 

Of course if you can save interest by making the balloon payment early, I would wait until the last 3 months to invest, and make the balloon payment as soon as possible or even make a larger monthly payment.

Online banks, like online shops, can have lower cost structures compared to their bricks-and-mortar peers. They may have fewer staff, less rental, and so on. If so, every dollar of profit after expenses needs somewhat less revenue support than peers with higher costs.

When new entrants compete against incumbents, pricing is a popular mechanism with which to get customers. By giving more interest for an equivalent product, they'd probably hope that more people would choose to keep their money with them instead with other banks. More established players have other levers to pull. For example, if you've been getting exceptional service from one bank, you might be happy to forego some interest to continue getting that service. This might be monetary, such as low mortgage costs, or non-monetary, such as simpler access to credit approvals. Or you might just like to be able to walk in and have staff recognise you on sight because you've been banking at that branch for years.

I can just keep the cash and pay interest on all three accounts until crisis is over.

What should i do?
",122124,"Keeping some liquid cash is sensible, but the exorbitant rates on your debt will hurt you long-term. Pay them off as quickly as safely possible.

Since you have high-interest debt, getting rid of that debt is more important than maintaining a large emergency fund. Having both savings and overdraft fees is illogical. However, I understand that you'd rather have cash than paying of other debts if you expect to be laid off soon.

To save the most money, the optimal solution is to pay off the highest-interest debt first. Here, that is the overdraft.

Unless you will also be able to pay off the other debts within a couple of months, it could be sensible to refinance. A small loan for £5000 at 6% over 12 months (~ £440/month) could give you breathing room to pay off all high-interest debts and stabilize your finances – if you are still eligible for such loans.

Aside from affecting job stability, the Covid-19 situation doesn't change a lot. If you've struggled to live without debt pre-Corona, it won't get easier now. That's why it could be helpful to pay off as much as possible now, so that you aren't saddled with endless interest payments in more difficult times: who knows how long this crisis will last? And you need to figure out why you have so much cash and so much debt, but that is out of scope here.
",Reasonable,"Bear in mind that the credit score is generated by some secret formula that will never be disclosed to you.  Attempting to game it is rarely worth the effort, especially if you end up paying excessive amounts of interest in doing so.

The purpose of a credit score is simply to answer the question ""if this person borrows money from us, how likely are they to pay it back on time?""

So the most important thing you should do is make payments on time.


  I wasn't sure what to title this question. I am new to building my
  credit score and using credit cards. I am hoping to clear up a few
  questions I have. One is, if I purchase something on my credit card
  and setup minimum monthly payments does that negatively affect my
  credit score? If so, and if I setup payments that are higher than that
  minimum monthly payment but less than paying in full every month does
  that affect my credit score less than just making minimum payments?


If you pay the card off in full every month, that shows you pay your debts and have no money problems.  That's good.

Paying only the minimum can lead to ever-increasing debt if you continue spending on the card.  Not only is that bad for you, as you are paying excessive amounts of interest every month, but if the debt gets too close to the credit limit, then it looks like you have money problems.  That's bad.


  Are there any cards that will allow me to disburse a debt over a
  period of time (with interest) without affecting my credit score? For
  instance, lets say I want to purchase a $300 item from a store which
  does not have a monthly payment feature to break that up; say for
  instance, into 3 $100 payments over 3 months. Are there any credit
  cards that will do that for me without it negatively impacting my
  credit score?


That would be any credit card.  You can pay off as much as you like any month, so long as it's at least the minimum amount.  If you want to pay off a third of the debt every month, that's fine.

",Reasonable,"You can't hold an investment directly in the ""10 year treasury bond"". You either buy an individual bond, say a 2007 bond maturing in 2017, or (most commonly) buy a bond fund that buys bonds for some time, then sells them and buys newer ones to maintain a range of maturities.

So the comparison is between an S&amp;P500 fund (I used SPY) and a bond fund of average maturity around 10 years (I used IEF). Here's a link comparing performance during the crisis.

Regarding what performs better than a 10-ish year treasury bond during a crisis, I'd say a longer treasury bond. There are maturities up to 30 years, and they did better during 2008 than shorter maturity bonds. However, those bonds expose you to significantly more fluctuations because of interest rate changes, so I'd avoid them unless you understand their risks.

  Chances are everyone who reads this StackExchange knows that debt is dangerous and should be avoided.


While I do agree that debt is dangerous and should be avoided, not everyone does.  Heck there are people on here that advocate taking pay day loans!  

Even the most debt adverse financial commentators suggest that a mortgage is an acceptable risk.  They may only advocate certain structures of mortgages, but they see it as a way for most families to build wealth.

Less debt adverse might suggest a well structured business loan in order to earn more money.  The business might be rental real estate properties or owning a franchise. Theoretically the difference between the finance charge and return on investment is great and they can earn money on the arbitrage.  

This is how, in my opinion, Altria sees this transaction.  Either the loss to their future profitability was perceived to be so great, or that they could make so much money off of the acquisition that it was worth financing that transaction.

Companies do this all the time.  For example, Darden will open new restaurants while they are holding debt and paying a dividend.  There are countless other examples.

The dividend is seen as a very different matter.  Many companies pay a dividend, despite its tax inefficiency, because it increase confidence in the company.  They may even see it as a commitment to long term employees, that are now retired, that acquired the stock over many years of payroll deduction.  They even get a lot of free marketing from paying a constant or even increasing dividend.  Dividends tend to be a very sacred thing and the hallmark of a ""blue chip"" stock.

6194,123306,Should I ask the seller of a house for a price reduction given a recession is almost certain?,"I've gone sale agreed (note: ""sale agreed"" means the sale has been agreed in principle - no contracts have been signed, no non-refundable deposits have been made etc.) on a house. The market I'm currently in was extremely competitive, houses were all generally going for significantly more than their asking price, as mine did.

I have nearly everything ready - loan arranged, survey of the house completed, solicitor ready to sign everything.

Now with Covid, a recession is more than likely coming our way.

Furthermore, with lock-downs in place - the seller is extremely unlikely to find an alternative buyer in the near future (it's an executor sale if that makes any difference).

I was thinking of trying to put some pressure onto the seller to lower the agreed price.

While I don't want to lose the house (and the money we have spent so far on legal etc.), I would also like to take advantage of potentially lower mortgage repayments.

Is it a bad idea to put this to the estate agent and be forthright about exactly why I'm asking to lower the price? Is there a ""reasonable"" amount to lower the purchase price by?

Edit

My intention here isn't to ""screw"" the seller as several commentators assume that I am trying to do.

At the end of the day, I'm a first time buyer who has effectively agreed to buy a house at ""peak"" economic health. Within a couple of weeks of this agreement, economic impacts of covid-19 were already being felt and the short / medium term prospects are not good.

At the end of this year, if covid hasn't wreaked enough havoc, there is a very real risk that Brexit could have an extremely negative impact on my country.

So while the honorable thing to do might be to commit to the agreed purchase price, this might be an extremely unwise decision from a personal finance point of view.

""Why don't you just pull out of the sale then?"" 

I could do that, that leaves the seller in a very bad position as well - it will be extremely unlikely they will be able to find another buyer in the short / medium term - so giving them an opportunity to consider my concerns might be better than simply walking away.
",123310,"You could ask, but you risk the seller deciding to just cancel and put the property back on the market once restrictions lift, shutting you out.

  What factors should be considered? 



How much do you have in an ""emergency fund""? If you have enough cash on hand to handle most true emergencies (maybe a few thousand dollars in case your A/C goes out or your car loses its transmission), then put everything else towards the debt. If you have a huge emergency fund but are paying interest on debt, then that money is costing you in interest payments.
Why do you have debt in the first place? If you use this one-time income to pay down credit card debt but don't solve the underlying spending problem, then you'll just be back where you started at some point. Make sure you spend less than you make (ideally by not using credit cards at all) and get a grip on your budget, or your efforts will be in vain.


Remember that you ""earn"" money by paying off debt equal to the interest rate that you pay off.  For example, if the annual interest rate on your debt is 10% and you pay $1,000 to it, you ""earn"" a roughly 10% annual return on that $1,000 by saving you $100 in interest over a year (plus a small amount due to compounding).

1101,13437,When is coronavirus leading to FIP contagious?,"I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.

According to this article from the Cornell Veterinary School, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)

When is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?

I am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be infectious.  (If he's also infected then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.)
",15931,"Veterinary partner is a very reliable website that should be able to answer your questions on FIP

Your cat wont get FIP by being with an FIP + cat, it can however contract coronavirus. And yes as you mentioned, not all coronavirus cats will develop FIP.

From my ""Common Diseases of Companion Animals"" textbook:


  80% to 90% of cats in catteries have antibodies to FECV and these cats shed virus intermittently.


That being said by continuously disinfecting and only having one/two cat(s) in your home you can eventually clear out FECV (most common household disinfectants work).

You can check your current cat what his current anti-body levels are for coronavirus if you're concerned about a new cat coming in as well.

An excerpt from veterinary partner on FECV:


  An active infection lasts several weeks to a few months. Virus is shed in the infected cat’s stool during this period. If the cat is reinfected, virus sheds again for weeks to months. During this time, the cat may or may not seems at all ill. Some infected cats do not shed virus.
  
  The mutation to a form of virus that can cause FIP is more likely to occur in an immune-compromised cat. Most cats with FIP are less than one year old (their immaturity is their immune compromise). Crowding is also an important source of immune-compromise. Another important factor in mutation is multiple exposure/infections. When cats keep getting reinfected, the virus they carry has more chance of mutating to a form that causes FIP.


I've only seen 3 cases of FIP in almost 4 years in practice, it's not very common.

  Dog lovers in South Africa have been ordered not to take their beloved pets for a walk for three weeks, Police Minister Bheki Cele said at a news conference.

",27395,"Dogs - like humans - usually choose a certain place as their ""bathroom"" to do their business there. As long as the poop doesn't pile up without ever disappearing, they will stick to this bathroom.

Your dog will hold its pee and poop as long as possible, because it cannot go to the bathroom. That is very uncomfortable and can have negative effects on the health.
Sooner or later, your dog has to make a mess, every single day. It'll learn that the toilet is now inside the house and it will be extremely hard to stop this behavior again if the covid-19 crisis is over.

The main things to monitor in new/stray cats are appetite, vomition, lethargy, runny poops, struggling or inability to urinate and breathing and eye problems. Common diseases/conditions that hit suddenly includes Feline Herpiesvirus (eyes, mouth, lungs), Feline Corona virus (appetite, diarrhoea), stress (urination problems).

As a stray you unfortunately don't know the history and diseases like Feline Leukaemia (FeLV) and Feline Aids (FIV) is a definitely a possibility, even if they are vaccinated, but for example not tested. These diseases can take months to show clinical signs (weight loss, inappetance, lethargy, fever, other diseases, etc. etc.)
",Reasonable,"I used to have a Birman.  I LOVE the breed and really would like to get another one someday, but I am hesitant.  I bought my cat, Whopper, in 1999.  (It was ""the year of the W"" and she had been very big for a female kitten.  I had shown up to buy her sister, Whistlepop, but had left with Whopper - my very own fluffy little malted milk ball. =)  When Whopper was about three years old, she developed Lymphocytic-Plasmacytic Gingivitis Stomatitis (LPGS).  My poor, sweet girl had such problems with her mouth.  It was horrible.  I didn't find online at the time that Birmans were susceptible to this, but Persians were, and I’d found a couple different websites where the authors stated that some people believed the Birman breed had a strong influx of Persian in their development.  There is no cure for LPGS.  During my research, I also found that Birmans had an increased susceptibility to develop FIP.  Whopper never got FIP though.  She died in 2006 right before her 7th birthday of kidney disease.  I didn’t realize there was a problem until it showed up in her pre-surgical bloodwork when she went in to get her teeth cleaned.  By then, she was pretty far along in the progression of the disease.  I was heartbroken.  It’s unusual for a 6-year-old cat to get kidney disease.  When I researched the disease in the Birman breed after she was diagnosed, I found that Persians had a high risk of developing kidney disease, and Birmans had a moderate risk.  I cried for over a year after she died.  It was four years before I could think about her without tears coming to my eyes.  We had been very tightly bonded.  I close with some advice for you:  No matter WHAT breed you choose, there WILL be health problems associated with that breed.  Spend lots of time researching the breed and also choosing from the most reputable breeders you can find who test their cats for problems before breeding and breed ONLY for the betterment of the breed.  Be willing to spend more for your kitten.  Testing costs money.  Do your very best to get the best odds for yourself in obtaining the healthiest kitten possible.  I’m sure this is an old question and the person who originally asked it has long since found a kitten for themselves, but I would like to help others who read this in the future.

But I've heard that cats also need mental stimulation.  How do I best provide that, both when I'm playing with him and when he's alone in the house?  I know that there are ""puzzle toys"" that reward solving the puzzle by dispensing kibble or treats, but I'd rather not have that happening all over the house (especially where any missed kibbles could be ground into rugs).  What other options do I have for exercising his mind as well as his body?

Cats also include the environment in their role-playing.  They'll creep around furniture to sneak up and attack an unsuspecting table tennis ball, crawl behind a sofa to lie in wait.

So you could try moving items of their environment to allow them to explore the house in different ways.  Not large pieces of furniture (although you could if you wanted to), smaller items like side tables and foot-stools might provide some variety.

one cat is less than a year, 10 months perhaps, and other is probably older than 2 years, both are not neutered yet. 

i want to neuter them, but I'm scared with the risks. 

I'm scared because I had a cat suspected with FIP before they came. They have been exposed with the FIP cat for 2 months, but they never share litter box. 

Now the FIP cat had been gone for three months already, and the other two cats are still healthy and active.

Neutering a cat is a simple and easy operation that causes very little stress for the cat and your cat will not need any special care after this have been done.
",Reasonable,"Start slowly.  Reintroduce the toy. Does she cower from it? If so, put some smell or flavor on it. Let her sniff it/lick it. Then put it away. Repeat until she stops cowering. Put the toy(s) out of site or in a bucket when it is no longer play time.  

Next, if she is no longer cowering from it, non-chalantly use it to groom and pet her (I do this to get my dogs okay with the nail clipper). That will get her smell on it and build an association of good feelings.

Do likewise with the tennis ball if she cowers from the presence of the tennis ball.

In the meantime, try fetch with a stick. Get some gloves if you don't want to dirty your hands picking up the stick or toy. Rebuild her fetch=FUN! habit. Once she's okay with the long handle ball thrower, back at it.

Do note if you go the stick route if she cowers from the sight of you holding up a long object.

4617,27417,Cat Vomiting Every Day,"My cat (approximately 16 years old, short hair, no specific breed, indoor cat) has been vomiting pretty much every day (sometimes multiple times) for almost a month.

She had a scare with her kidneys about 2 years ago (elevated results of urea and creatine) and has had blood tests regularly since but her levels fell and have been good ever since.

Her brother passed away a few years ago from stomach cancer, and he showed similar symptoms in the beginning but when we've taken her to the vets they've done X-Ray and ultrasound and other than a slight thickening of the stomach lining couldn't see any lumps or anything out of the ordinary. She has also had blood tests and everything looks fine, very good kidney results, no sign of liver issues, no sign of diabetes.

She's been on antacids and laxatives from the vet (as much as we can get in her, she's not good with meds and gets very distressed) but they don't seem to be having any effect.
When she's been in to the vets they sometimes give her an anti-nausea injection which stops her being ill for a few days and then it starts up again.
She's also had antibiotics, dewormer, B12 and a steroid injection at various times. Any improvement is only temporary for a few days and then she starts vomiting again.

She's a fussy eater and she gets dry food (Purina One, various flavours), tuna and white fish. Also occasionally ham. She won't eat much else. She gets sick mostly in the morning and we suspected Bilious Vomiting Syndrome, but she already has food down through the day and gets other regular food throughout the day too, including late at night and that hasn't improved anything.

Most days she might be sick once (and it tends to be thick and dark brown, occasionally with food in or clumps of hair but mostly liquid) but sometimes it's two or three times.
She's otherwise eating fine, drinking and urinating a normal amount and pooing regularly (not sure the laxative is making any difference).

The vets seem to be a bit stumped and just keep telling us to give her the laxatives / antacid but there's obviously something else going on.

The only major change recently is that we were giving her a glycosamine and mineral supplement for arthritis which we were mixing with milk to get her to take it as it was the only way to guarantee she'd take it all. We ran out of the first course a couple of weeks before she started getting sick and didn't get any more before she got ill, so it's been about six weeks since she had the supplement or any milk.

We're really worried but don't know what else to do. Everything is also complicated by the fact we're in the UK and the country is on lockdown because of Coronavirus so while the vet is still open it's not easy to get an appointment.

We're waiting on a stronger antacid from the vets and we're going to try to give her exclusively white fish for a few days to see if diet is contributing (but it's the same diet she's been on for years).

Any ideas what it could be or what we could try next?
The fact she seems to be in good health (particularly for her age) is what's confusing us as all the things we've seen that fit have a list of other symptoms that she just hasn't got.
",27419,"NEVER GIVE YOUR CAT MILK cats and all other adult mamals are unable to digest lactose it makes them and many of us ill.

The negative effect of giving milk is most likely stronger than the positive effect of glycosamine and the mineral suplement.

As elmy say in her answer if the vomit is dark it might be internal bleeding so you will need to take your cat to the vet for diagnosing and treatment of this.

Giving white fish is a good idea and you can use the juice from the white fish and mix glycosamine and mineral suplement into this,to get the juice out of the white fish you need to do as follows.

Use one of your smallest pots add the white fish(it is best if it have been frozen)add a couple of spoons of water and slowly heat until the water boils,use a fork to split up the fish so it gets heated evenly use little heat you need to keep the water/juice.

You can use a strainer to remove the juice or you can use the fish and juice as it is,cool it down and mix in the glycosamine and minerals hopefully your cat will eat it.

As other mention in the comments giving only white fish over time is not good,and it will lead to lack of essensial nutrients so you need to go back to normal food after two days even if your cat manages to keep the food down.

  On the day before the airing of the final episode of School Days in Japan, a 16 year old girl killed her father with an axe in Kyoto. Due to an extremely similar scene present in the episode and to avoid relation to the axe murder, TV Kanagawa replaced it with a half hour of unrelated scenery with “Air on a G String” playing in the background. Among the shock and rage expressed among fans, a 4chan user commented “Nice Boat”, referring to the Norwegian ferry shown in the replacement footage. Immediately the phrase became a meme, however is far more popular in Japan than in English speaking countries.




The part with the boat is easily viewable on Youtube and other sites, but I haven't been able to find the full episode.

",Accepted,"The Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan are caused by a special kind of ocular chakra originating in an Uchiha's brain. Usually, a cause of powerful emotion will awaken the Sharingan, and great loss will evolve it into the Mangekyou. Once unlocked, activating them is fairly easy. They can be transplanted, and even retain their abilities. Though it may have been an exception due to its spacetime powers, Kakashi's case showed it could even evolve to the Mangekyou despite not being in an Uchiha. Kakashi could activate and deactivate the Mangekyou form. However, he could never deactivate the Sharingan, and hence had to cover up his Sharingan eye when not in use to preserve chakra.

Next, after Obitos's death, he used his space time powers to transfer his chakra to Kakashi. By doing so, he also transfered his ocular chakra, which temporarily awakened Obito's Mangekyou in Kakashi. Once that Chakra was used up and the Sharingan released, it was gone for good.

Lastly, there is one who went through a very similar situation, Madara. As pointed out, Madara at one time had Obito's Mangekyou and his own Rinnegan. By having a 2nd eye, despite having unlocked the Rinnegan, did not evolve it into a Rinnegan. He even transplanted regular Sharingan before his death, but they did not evolve into Rinnegan either, despite up to several years between him giving his Rinnegan to Nagato, transplanting the spare Sharingan and dying.

Now, of course those were not Madara's real eyes, but the fact that he had the ocular chakra required to awaken even the Rinnegan, but couldn't do so with a Sharingan and a Mangekyou eye says a lot.

With all that established, We have a decent amount of evidence backing up what would happen if Naruto grew a new eye for Obito. Most likely, what would happen is the new eye would be a normal Uchiha eye, which is almost identical to any other regular eye. It would have the potential to unlock the Sharingan and Mangekyou Sharingan, and Obito could probably more easily unlock them than normal, but its impossible to say if it would happen immediately, take months to do so, or anywhere in between.

So, transplanting Obito's left eye into Kakashi, and then having Naruto regrow Obitos eye would likely be able to create 2 eyes with Obito's Mangekyou powers, given an unknown amount of time before he could reawaken his powers.

That however shows the main reason why they didn't do so, besides the situation preventing them from thinking about it. They couldn't risk it not working instantly. Obito was under Zetsus control until Kaguya showed up, and they needed everything they had to just barely pull off that victory. Obito having his left eye's powers is what both got Sasuke out of the dimension Kaguya threw him into alone, and saved Kakashi from her All-Killing Ash Bones. The odds that his new left eye being fully awakened to Mangekyou within the few minutes before it was needed are slim to none. Then after it was used twice in critical circumstances, he turned to ash.

Maroon notes in the comments that the dates line up better for 2006. The phasing out of the Souseki notes began in 2004, so 2006 is a plausible year as well. The novels began their run in August 2005, so it's possible that Nisio Isin looked to March 2006 as the starting point for the series.

Smartphones do exist in the world of Monogatari; in the preview on Episode 7 of Nisemonogatari, Kaiki complains that after Hitagi smashed his phone, he went to buy a new one and could only find smartphones, which he dislikes. Here's a hard-to-see picture of my television screen that shows it:



Flip phones are actually still pretty common in Japan; see this Answerman column. 

As a side note, the male protagonist hiding porn books in his room is a time-honored tradition of the genres that Monogatari draws on, harem and school action. Suruga also fills her room up with cheap BL books instead of going on the Internet and reading slash fiction. Monogatari is a mixture of real and hyper-real, so sometimes it just plays by the rules of fiction.

Click on it, and most (though I don't think all) of the interface gets changed over to English. Product descriptions and stuff don't, though.

Once you've done that, you'll need to make an account, even if you have an account on Amazon US or Amazon UK or whatever. The process is the same as making an account on any other Amazon site.

The product you want to purchase is either this one for BD, or this one for DVD. In either case, you can pre-order it. If you do place a pre-order, the product should leave Amazon's Japanese warehouse on release day and get to you probably less than a week later.

As far as I know, there is only one option available for global shipping from Amazon Japan. You will be charged probably $10-12 for shipment to the US. I don't know about other countries. If you are in the US, you should choose to pay in USD, so as to avoid foreign transaction fees on your credit card.

Incidentally, you can also preorder the second movie (BD, DVD) for when it releases on 2 Apr 2016.



Much of the advice above is generally applicable to purchasing any BDs and DVDs from Amazon Japan. Amazon Japan isn't always the cheapest option, but it is definitely the most convenient, at least for US-based buyers. However, if you are planning on purchasing a large number of items in a short period of time, you may be able to save on shipping by using a proxy service like Tenso.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak - WHO



On 2020.01.30, the Director-General of Emergency Committee convened by the WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV (2019 Novel Coronavirus) constitutes a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern).

Actions by country/region:

Hong Kong declares coronavirus emergency. (2020.01.25)

Italy declares state of emergency over coronavirus. (2020.01.31)

U.S.A declared a public health emergency (PHE). (2020.01.31)

South Korea raised threat alert to the highest level. (2020.02.23)

Some provinces of China lower emergency response as epidemic slows. (2020.02.26)

My question:

What are the consequences of PHEIC, to China and to other countries?


",49901,"tl;dr: There aren't any tangible consequences, unless China or other countries decide to take any.



The World Health Organization is an agency of the United Nations. But it does not have any legislative powers. Its activities are limited to spending its budget on funding health-related research, spreading health information and funding healthcare projects which operate within the legal framework of the countries they operate in. 

It might advise governments to take actions, like for example fund healthcare measures, discourage/promote products depending on their health impact, enact quarantines or discourage/promote certain medical procedures. But it does not have the authority to enforce any of those measures themselves.

Now what exactly does it mean that the WHO declares a public health emergency of international concern? It is basically just a declaration, stating that the WHO believes that this is a problem people should take seriously. The WHO has done that 5 times before, each time in case of a global outbreak of an acute infectious disease:


2009 (Swine Flu)
2014 (Polio)
2014 (Ebola)
2016 (Zika)
2019 (Kivu Ebola)

",Accepted,"It could provide cover/justification for both inter-national and intra-national emergency measures, such as quarantines, enforced confinements and travel restrictions.

For example, let's take the court challenges to the Trump administration early Muslim visa bans.  A similar hearing, not necessarily in the US, held to decide on the legality of a travel ban from China, would have information available that indicated that the issue was generally considered to be a problem by medical professionals, not just by the administration.

Italy has just declared some level of regional quarantines.  Legal challenges to this decision by affected individuals would likely be affected by the WHO's declaration.

2764,50066,Why is COVID-19 prompting such wide scale action versus other infectious diseases?,"The COVID-19 outbreak has been dominating the news recently, with loads of headlines and efforts being made to stop it from spreading.

Why this disease? It's not one of the most lethal ones, or one of the deadliest. Compare:


COVID-19 - infected 24,478; deaths 492
Malaria - infected 228 million; deaths 405,000 (2018 data)
Tuberculosis - infected 25% of world population, i.e. ~2 billion; deaths 1.6 million (2017 data)
HIV/AIDS - infected 37.9 million; 1.7 million new cases a year; deaths 770,000 (2018 data)


Compared to malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, the COVID-19 outbreak is pretty much a rounding error.

In terms of lethality, COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 1.4-6.5%. This is still well below the lethality of tuberculosis (43%) and HIV/AIDS (80-90% after 5 years if untreated), although it is more lethal than malaria (~0.3%)

It seems like, objectively, COVID-19 is a very small fish in the pond of infectious diseases. It's not like the three diseases above are unique either; there're lots more diseases that affect &amp; kill more people than nCoV (e.g. measles, leishmaniosis). Yet, right now, when people die of COVID-19 they make the news, while thousands of people die of the other three diseases every day without getting a mention. Further, COVID-19 is apparently attracting lots of research efforts to treat it. Why is it being prioritized over other infectious diseases?

I'm looking for objective answers as to why COVID-19 matters so much.
",50068,"The short answer to this question is that 2019-nCoV is new. All the other diseases you mentioned are known quantities: epidemiologists have a good idea how they behave, how they spread, what is likely to happen in a variety of different scenarios, etc. But this disease represents a new mutation that behaves differently from other coronaviruses. It's far more transmissible than other coronaviruses, and worse, seems to be transmissible through casual contact: not intimate contact, blood or fluid exposure, not through an intermediary vector like a tick or flea. Currently the death toll is low, but researchers simply do not have enough data to know whether that trend will continue. 

Remember, the death rate of influenza is lower than that of this coronavirus. The 1958 and 1967 influenza pandemics had death rates of about 0.1%, and the 1918 pandemic had a death rate of about 2.5%*. But those pandemics killed millions because they were so transmissible they infected hundreds of millions. If the coronavirus follows that pattern and turns pandemic, we might expect to see any city of a million or so people suffer 20,000 to 30,000 deaths over the course of a couple of months (say 400-500 per day), which is a huge number of people dying by any calculus. Discretion is definitely the better part of valor, here.
",Accepted,"It's been called the ""cycle of oppression"":


  The oppressed group behavior model suggests that persons who are in groups that are subordinate to more powerful groups in their society learn certain behavior patterns that, although necessary for their survival, lead to a cycle of further oppression


I don't know if the term has gained much traction (with this meaning). But it is based on the philosophy of Paulo Freire, who argues it in a bit more detail, as summarized in IEP:


  Freire warns the oppressed against becoming oppressors on two counts: (1) whether the oppressed gain power and use this power to oppress their previous oppressor; or (2) in the case of the oppressed gaining power over other oppressed people and becoming their oppressors, as they seek their own individual liberation. The danger of a previously oppressed person becoming an oppressor is due to their ambiguous duality. Freire points out that the oppressed are at one and the same time both themselves (the oppressed) and the oppressor, whose consciousness they have internalized. Due to this ambiguous duality and the internalization of their oppressors, the oppressed seek to become like the oppressors and share in their way of life.


A more general concept is that history repeats itself, perhaps in ""disguised"" ways.

Some ancient Greeks posited a more elaborate version... the Kyklos:


  According to Polybius, who has the most fully developed version of the cycle, it rotates through the three basic forms of government, democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy and the three degenerate forms of each of these governments ochlocracy, oligarchy, and tyranny. Originally society is in ochlocracy but the strongest figure emerges and sets up a monarchy. The monarch's descendants, who because of their family's power lack virtue, become despots and the monarchy degenerates into a tyranny. Because of the excesses of the ruler the tyranny is overthrown by the leading citizens of the state who set up an aristocracy. They too quickly forget about virtue and the state becomes an oligarchy. These oligarchs are overthrown by the people who set up a democracy. Democracy soon becomes corrupt and degenerates into ochlocracy, beginning the cycle anew.

3662,50505,How has the US prepared for the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak?,"President Trump speaking yesterday (Feb 26th 2020) gave an update about the response of the US to the novel coronavirus outbreak. In an announcement that introduced a new team to tackle the virus, Trump said that


  Because of all we've done (so far), the risk to the American people remains very low.


and that


  It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it. We hope it doesn't spread. There's a chance that it won't spread, too. And there's a chance that it will.


The president's remarks were then followed by Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who reiterated the organisation's remarks of February 25th where the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, said that:


  Ultimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country.


What measures, referred to by the President, have already been taken by the US government to prepare for the virus? Which of these have the Trump administration been responsible for? What is the purpose of the new team announced yesterday?
",50629,"Rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. There's now outrage that the CDC has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of NIH (which in this case stands for ""not invented here""), rather than adopt the one used by the WHO (and which was developed in Germany)...


  On Monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, Trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. With the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
  
  But many scientists wonder if the moves come too late. [...] Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?
  
  “Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the C.D.C. “There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”
  
  Still, Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving. Other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.
  
  “The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”
  
  Officials at the C.D.C. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The agency abruptly canceled a news conference on Monday just as it was to begin. Officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many Americans had been tested.
  
  In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits — each of which could run about 800 tests — to state and local health laboratories. But some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.
  
  A three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta.
  
  The C.D.C. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. But those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.
  
  Getting results from the C.D.C. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have had recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.
  
  Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.
  
  The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
  
  [...]
  
  “We have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually ‘ready, set, go,’ and here we were — ‘ready, set, wait’,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.
  
  Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. If labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the C.D.C.’s version or waiting for a replacement.
  
  Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has probably tested millions.
  
  “How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.
  
  Soon after the virus surfaced in China, the C.D.C. got to work on its own test. “Generally, C.D.C. provides these tests for the world,” said Dr. Frieden.
  
  But German researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the World Health Organization for distribution around the world.
  
  After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.
  
  With F.D.A. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the W.H.O. instead of creating a new one from scratch, Dr. Mina said. The government could do so even now.
  
  “It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said.

  Do individual countries control transit zone law? Or are they covered by international law, since they are international zones?


The former with a twist. Individual countries control transit zones on their territory, as in these are sovereign territory rather than international territory. They're just buffer zones where you keep visitors around until they've effectively crossed the border.

The twist is that, yes, there are international treaties that relate to them -- see e.g. the ones that relate to aviation law. Further, the laws that apply to them continue to evolve. See for instance this paper on Special International Zones, which are glorified mobile international transit zones.

4006,50624,COVID-19 in US healthcare: who pays for testing?,"If, as a US citizen or resident, I had flu-like symptoms and if I was not covered by Medicaid/Medicare and didn't have health insurance, who would be liable for paying for COVID-19 test diagnostics in a US hospital?

I saw an offhand remark about ""the cost and people not getting tested as a result"", in an online forum.  It wasn't even a claim that it was happening, more like a quip that it might happen.

The US healthcare vs Euro/Canadian-style coverage debate has been done to death, but it usually revolves around the problems lack of coverage brings to the people who are ill.  This is not what I am asking about.

An epidemic situation however brings a different dynamic:  there's a vested interested for everyone else that sick people are identified as such and isolated, it's not just about the being well-being of the patients.  To assist in containment, you want to remove as many barriers to early diagnosis as possible.

Is there/could there be some form of emergency funding for at least the tests themselves, at the federal level?  One model is for example, the financial arrangements around vaccination programs.

Edit:

the question concerns the procedure for the entire test, i.e. lab services as well as clinic time:  seeing a doctor/nurse, taking the tests and getting the results.  Nothing more, but also all of what's necessary for a YES/NO answer wrt having COVID-19 or not.  

Bryan's answer is great wrt to the kit and lab services themselves, but someone still needs to interview you and take whatever samples are necessary to send off for testing,

Do these arrangements vary by state?  Or does the Federal govt, through the CDC, have jurisdiction?

State vs Federal:  it seems to me that a Federal-level guidance ought to be faster than waiting for all 50 states to come up with their own programs individually.

A recent New York Times article presents a case study of exactly the sort of scenario described in the question.

Americans who were living in China and evacuated from Wuhan did not have health insurance in the US and were given a $3,918 bill for care during quarantine, including $2,598 for ambulance transportation. Neither ultimately tested positive.


  He did receive a document upon leaving quarantine directing him to contact a government email address with any medical bills. He sent an email on Feb. 24 detailing the charges and asking what would be done.
  
  “My question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?” Mr. Wucinski wrote in his message.
  
  He has not received a response, he said.


Since then, after being contacted by the Times, the hospital stated the bill was in error:


  When contacted by The New York Times, a Rady Children’s Hospital spokesman said the physicians’ bill had been sent in error and that the family would not be held responsible for the charges.


..but it is not clear whether this is a matter of policy or a public relations move by the hospital, nor is it clear how these matters will be handled going forward. It also does not yet resolve the $2600 ambulance bill (of course this is all still pending).

The government can order mandatory quarantines, but as far as who pays:


  “There is no uniform practice,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. “They do have the powers, but they’ve almost never used them in modern times.”


Without some new government intervention, it seems that for now costs will either be charged to patients or simply absorbed by the treating facilities (by not billing).



The American Hospital Association and American Nurses Association on Feb 27, 2020 have asked for the government to fund care related to the epidemic. It seems likely that there will be further political fights over what exactly is done next.



update: As of March 4th, 2020, an agreement was reached in the House on a bill for COVID-2019 funding, which is expected to pass there and later in the Senate. This bill does not address how to deal with care and testing for the uninsured, though it includes state and local funding. It's unclear at this time how those funds could/will be used:


  Congress didn't explicitly address how to handle funding for mandatory quarantines or the uninsured. The package would send $950 million in state and local grants, with half of the money due within 30 days. States will receive a minimum of $4 million.

It banned the following things:


Assault style rifles. (a rifle having at least 2 of: folding or telescoping stocks, pistol grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor or threaded barrel for one, barrel attached grenade launcher.
Certain modifications to semi-automatic pistols and semiautomatic shotguns. (these are pretty similar to the rifle ban and can be found on wikipedia, I won't list them here).


As you can see, most of the things included in the ban were cosmetic enhancements to a gun. It would be impossible to list specific models as many guns are customizable with any and all of the enhancements that are listed here. So a few specific guns (those listed in the question) were banned, but mostly the ban was governing the style of rifles that could be sold, not the models.

This graphic from the Violence Policy Center shows the modifications made to popular guns to make them compliant with the assault weapons ban. Model numbers we changed, and features were modified (note the lack of a flash supressor on the TEC AB-10, the shorter clip on the Match Target etc), the SSR-74-2 is based on the AK-74 (same family as the AK-47), but uses a different caliber bullet. (It should be noted that as with the SSR-74, some of these are more than cosmetic changes, this is due to the entire model being banned, not the cosmetic bans)



As far as how the banned models differed. You'd see a shotgun with either a folding stock or a pistol grip, not both. Or a rifle with just a pistol grip, but not a folding stock. Or just a bayonet mount, but not a pistol grip, or folding stock.

4412,50787,"COVID-19: why are countries still introducing quarantines for travelers from affected regions, even though it's been proven they don't work?","Various governments seem to be playing whack-a-mole with travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines in the recent COVID-19 epidemic. First Chinese residents were banned from numerous countries. Afterwards travel bans expanded to South Korea, Japan, Iran and most recently Italy. Yet despite all the travel restrictions, the virus managed to successfully spread out all across the globe. 

So why continue with the practice of restricting foreign travel, especially when the virus has already been identified to be spreading at the local level? E.g. why doesn't the US remove travel restrictions on Chinese visitors, given that the virus has already been detected in numerous states?

Update: There are now 10 thousand official cases in the US, but travel restrictions are still in place for some reason.
",50790,"While it has clearly been shown by the virility of the virus so far that travel restrictions will not stop the inevitable community spread of the illness, and that their effectiveness as impeding the spread of the virus is small, the aim of the policy is no longer to stop the virus, but to delay it. This was confirmed as current policy in the UK's response to the virus by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, on March 5th.

There are a few reasons why this is the goal of many governments. Firstly, if the peak of the pandemic can be delayed, this allows plans to be put in place for management of the crisis. For example, in the UK, plans have been floated that would allow final year medical students and trainee doctors to take on hospital duties during the nine week period that the virus is currently predicted to have the highest effect on the NHS, in order to mitigate the strain on the service.

Secondly, delaying the spread of the virus allows time for a vaccine to be developed. While research on this is progressing quickly, it will still take time for the vaccine to pass clinical trials and be approved for human usage. In addition, as @Patricia Shanahan points out in the comments, the effectiveness of existing drugs already approved for treating similar respiratory diseases can be evaluated, which could be ready sooner than developing brand new drugs or a vaccine.

Finally, as health services are acknowledged as being under the most strain during the winter months, the best time for the pandemic to peak would be in the middle of summer.

To this end, the policy of travel bans, while having been shown to be relatively ineffective at preventing the spread of the disease outright, is being used to delay the spread of the virus as much as possible, to allow national governments to prepare for the full impact of the peak of the predicted pandemic.
",Accepted,"Background


  Britain's railways were nationalised by Labour in 1948 and returned to private hands by John Major's Conservative government in 1993.
  Labour was initially committed to renationalisation but the policy was dropped when Tony Blair came to power in 1997. Track, signalling and stations were taken out of private hands, and put into a not-for-profit company, Network Rail, after the collapse of Railtrack in 2002.


Why Re-Nationalise?


  The cost of the railway to the taxpayer has subsequently more than doubled in real terms, a rise out of all proportion to the 33% increase in train services over the same period. 
  
  The cost rises stem from wastage as shareholder dividend pay-outs, other inefficient private sector financing and inefficiencies created by fragmentation of the railway.
  
  The wastage amounts to over £1bn per year, enough to cut fares by 20% if the railway were reunified as a public company.
  
  ...run by companies that are wholly or partly publicly owned, but by other countries. Deutsche Bahn is foremost - they even run the Royal Train - and the German Government have said ""We're skimming profit from the entire Deutsche Bahn...it is invested in the rail network here in Germany"". 
  
  So, if you are reading this on an overcrowded train with a ticket that made a painful hole in your wallet, take heart from your generous contribution to improvement of Germany's fine publicly-owned railway. 


In short, re-nationalise to remove the inefficiencies in the fragmented railway system, provide more accountability, prevent ""off-shoring"" of profits from operating the railway network by foreign, state-owned, firms. Finally - make fares cheaper by reducing cost.

Why Keep Privatised?


  The UK's railway network was built privately and competitively and by some way its most successful years were the private eras between 1830 and 1922 and 1994 to the present. 
  
  Returning it to centralised state control would be a step backwards and a mistake. 
  
  Instead we should end the practice of franchising, which creates private monopolies, and allow real competition and diversity.
  
  The solution to our current problems is not more state bungling, it is a return to diversity, competition and open markets.


In short, keep privatised to avoid a step backward, because the railway was privatised during it's most successful years. End franchising which creates per-route monopolies.

Bernie Sanders and the Myth of Low Youth Turnout in the Democratic Primary

",50821,"There's a lot of spin going on in all camps, including the Sanders camp. This is par for the course in a political election year.

The article you cited is guilty of the same criticisms it makes of other articles. It fails to provide any concise information about how many voters in the 18-29 age range in 2020 turned out compared to 2016.

In fairness, this is partly because election officials do not track voters by age when they vote. So the only way to know anything about this kind of metric is to look at the same exit polls the article rejects as inaccurate.

The Sanders campaign, like other campaigns, do their own polling and sampling. So they have pretty much the best idea of anyone as to how well they've really done. So listen to what Bernie himself said:

""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing in young people in? And the answer is 'no',"" he told reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday.

""We're making some progress but historically everybody knows that young people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote,"" Sanders went on. ""I think that will change in the general election. But to be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the process. It is not easy.""

The data shows that Sanders' overall vote count is running 20-30% LOWER than in 2016 in most states that have voted so far, despite the fact that across-the-board vote count is running 10-30% HIGHER than in 2016. Sanders defenders argue that this is because the field was so much bigger and stronger than in 2016, but I see this as a throwaway argument. If Sanders was really a strong vote-getter, he wouldn't be bleeding support compared to 2016 because the ones who voted for him then already knew him, whereas his opponents this year were mostly newcomers to the primaries. He already had name recognition that the others didn't have among Democratic voters.

So what does this broader insight tell us? Well, all of the polls we've seen say that Sanders' support levels are strongest among the 18-29 age range. So if he's hemorrhaging that much voter support in the overall numbers, it either means that the number of voters in the 18-29 range matched 2016 while the rest of his supporters disappeared almost completely into the woodwork, or (much more likely) his support among 18-29 year olds sagged compared to four years ago along with the other age groups.

Given Sanders' remarks Business Insider quoted, I'd go with the latter likelihood.
",Accepted,"TL;DR


The key founders of Russian Communism have openly declared that the Marxism and religion are „incompatible“. Namely, Marxism has declared the lines of conduct which are opposite to Orthodox Christianity, the most popular religion of the Russia;
Marxism, at least, as it has been understood by Russian Bolsheviks, was a dogmatic, non-scientific belief, hence, a direct competitor to many world's religions of the time.
The Russian Orthodox Church has been adopted by KGB during the times of WWII, when it became apparent that Marxist ideology is not sufficient for controlling the masses.




Yielding the Floor to an Ideologist

First, a note on terminology.
Below, the quotes mistakenly (or deliberately) mix two terms: Marxism (an ideology) and Communism/Socialism (a ruling regime, or a type of a government). The question also contains this mistake. Communism (a regime) can't oppose religion in general, but Marxism (an ideology) can.

Nikolai Bukharin, one of the key ideologists of Russian Communism and prolific author on „revolutionary theory“, wrote in his book, The ABC of Communism (1919):


  Chapter 11: Communism and Religion
  § 89. Why religion and communism are incompatible
  
  Many weak-kneed communists reason as follows: 'Religion does not prevent my being a communist. I believe both in God and in communism. My faith in God does not hinder me from fighting for the cause of the proletarian revolution.'
  
  This train of thought is radically false. Religion and communism are incompatible, both theoretically and practically.
  
  In practice, no less than in theory, communism is incompatible with religious faith. The tactic of the Communist Party prescribes for the members of the party definite lines of conduct. The moral code of every religion in like manner prescribes for the faithful some definite line of conduct.

Competition

As I mention in another answer, Marxism is an ideology of class supremacy. Proletariat supposed to be the ""master class"", while others are ""lower"" ones.

However, the majority of proletarians were not familiar with Marxist ideology. There was also no goal to teach them with the details of Marxism. As a result, the vast majority of them simply believed that Marxism is right without knowing Marxist ideas in any depth, just the same way as in Tsarist Russia they believed in Christianity while sincerely thinking that Jesus Christ was a Russian, not to mention the deeper aspects of Christianity.

So, there was no place for two competing ideologies, equivalent to each other in most aspects, as it was understood by the overwhelming majority of the population.



Adoption by KGB

However, in 1940s the Stalin's regime has decided that suppressing the religion is not effective:

4508,50851,Why has Russia declined OPEC's request to cut oil production?,"On Friday, Russia declined to participate in a plan devised by the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut oil production levels, in order to keep oil prices steady in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The article describes this refusal as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.

What reasons has Russia given for their refusal to participate in the OPEC group's plan?
",50852,"Disclaimer: I'm no expert, this answer is based on my modest understanding of the situation at play.

The OPEC decision to cut oil production was meant to keep prices high: if every OPEC country were selling all the oil they could, it would drive prices down since there would be more supply than demand. So if every OPEC country agrees to sell only a limited amount of oil, the global supply matches the global demand and prices stay high. Naturally this works only if all the big oil producing countries play the game: it's tempting for a country to sell more than its agreed quota, especially if the price is high.

Russia is not an official member of OPEC, only an observer. As such, it is free to follow OPEC policies or not, depending on its own interests and strategy. I'm not aware of any official reason why Russia refused to follow this particular recent decision, but it looks like a rational economic decision: if many oil producers (competitors) reduce their supply and the prices are high, why would Russia limit their own supply if they have no obligation to?  

""This refusal is cited as the cause of the 10% oil price crash on Friday alone, which was exacerbated by a further 30% crash on Monday.""

This is not the full explanation: the Russian refusal led Saudi Arabia to cancel the original plan to reduce production (Guardian), and instead to flood the market with their own oil. This is what drove prices down sharply, especially in the current context of low demand due to the corona virus.

The Saudi surprise strategy could arguably be interpreted as a kind of tactical response against Russia's refusal to play according to OPEC rules: since Russia apparently wants to reap the benefits of high prices without sacrificing their own production, Saudi Arabia is telling them that ""two can play this game"". The effect is that all the oil producing countries are going to suffer from low prices, but some more than others:


  The new strategy adopted by Riyadh appears to target Russia and US shale oil firms, many of which are known to have high production costs and lose money when crude prices fall below $50 a barrel for more than a few months.


Saudi Arabia can produce oil at a lower cost than Russia and US shale oil industry, so they are probably trying to use the opportunity of the Russian refusal to get rid of some competitors: Saudi Arabia can afford to take a temporary economic hit, whereas many shale oil companies may go bankrupt quickly. Strategically, their initiative is certainly also meant to assert their dominance on the oil market.



[Added: a similar analysis by Kevin Drum, found just after posting my answer]


  The nickel version of this story is that oil prices started declining in February due to fears of lower demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak. OPEC tried to cut a deal with Russia to reduce output all around, but Russia balked. Saudi Arabia then decided to bring out its big guns, lowering prices immediately by about $7 per barrel and announcing that it would increase output in order to take share away from Russia. At that point the decline turned into a rout, with the price of WTI crude collapsing to $28 as I write this.

",Accepted,"My answer challenges the status quo mindset in the West (Russia bad, US &amp; West Europe good), so it might be a bit difficult to wrap your mind around it...

Putin made his thesis on energy - he knows what role energy plays in both geopolitics and overall economically both internally (for Russia) and globally. While the neocons have surrounded Russia militarily during the last 20 years, which is an existential threat, the control structures in the West have intentionally created an ""everything bubble"", forcing countries like Russia to give up their physical resources with imaginary ""valuable"" printed paper.

What Putin did (and this is why Russia walked out of the OPEC negotiations) was speed up the pricking of the everything bubble - the low oil prices will force the 40% of the junk bond companies (such as shale oil companies) to go bankrupt, which is one of the many negative vortices in the future total reset of the global financial system.

4623,50908,What is the significance of the WHO characterising Covid-19 as a pandemic?,"According to Reuters news agency, the Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference today (March 11th) that:


  We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and
  severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore
  made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic,


The same article, however, cites unnamed WHO officials as saying that the term ""pandemic"" is just a descriptive word and does not carry any legal significance.

What significance, if any, does the characterisation that has been made today have?
",50912,"Very little, practically speaking.

From the WHO:


  ""Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this #coronavirus. It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do""-
  @DrTedros


As discussed in this Q&amp;A, the definition of ""pandemic"" is fairly arbitrary. It does identify this virus, both in the present day and in history, as particularly significant, but there is nothing magical that changes with this definition from a political (or epidemiological) perspective, and there appear to be no particular political consequences of the definition from the WHO's perspective.

That is, there are no special funds or protocols that are activated by declaring a ""pandemic"" the way you might expect for various ""declarations of emergency"", which often activate laws that change regulations and procedures during the emergency and may allow for release of funds marked for that purpose.

From the content of the announcement, it seems like the WHO's primary goal in making this declaration is to reiterate the severity of the situation rather than to mark any particular milestone or to alter any guidance or recommendations.

4625,50916,What is the rationale behind delaying the imposition of more radical Covid-19 countermeasures?,"On March 3rd, the UK government released a publication detailing its Coronavirus action plan, which contains the four-stage plan that will be implemented throughout the country, in all four devolved nations, as the impact of the disease continues to worsen. Below is a brief summary of each stage:


Contain - identify cases as soon as possible, and attempt to prevent wider community spread of the virus. Powers have been given to enforce quarantines and extra funding granted to healthcare centres. The goal is to stop the virus from taking hold in the country.
Delay - if containment does not work, measures such as closing schools, banning large gatherings, and incentivising working from home will be introduced. The goal is to delay the inevitable spread of the virus for as long as possible.
Research - if measures taken to delay the virus prove ineffective, focus efforts on researching how to best fight the virus; working out how it spreads, and the best treatment methods. This includes research into vaccine development and deployment.
Mitigate - the last resort scenario, at this point the government will focus on keeping essential services such as police/fire/ambulance functional, as well as bringing retired and newly graduated doctors to the frontlines.


At the moment, the UK Government insists that the country is still in the containment phase, despite the country's Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief medical advisor, Prof. Chris Whitty telling MPs as early as March 5th that the UK ""was now ""mainly"" in the delay phase"".

At first glance the government's refusal to move to the delay phase, despite 460 total cases, and confirmed community spread, seems stubborn and almost deluded, however, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, Jeane Freeman told MSPs after attending a COBRA meeting on the 10th that 


  The timing of moving into the ‘delay’ phase, and what measures are
  judged to be the most effective in that phase, must be and are driven
  very firmly by scientific and clinical advice. Understandably people
  will be looking to the situation in other countries and questioning
  why some of the moves they are taking are not being made here yet in
  Scotland and in the UK.
  
  [...]
  
  Timing is critical. If we take those measures too soon, we will not
  have the impact we need. If we take them too late, we will not reduce
  demand [on the NHS] to the level we need


What is the risk behind taking these measures - i.e. moving into the delay phase - too soon? I note that Poland, for example, which has a fraction of the cases of the UK, will close all museums, cinemas, &amp; schools from Monday. Why might this be a mistake? Is there any research that has evaluated this?

(Note that although the example I have given is UK-based, I am also interested in answers that refer to the general postponement of more extreme countermeasures internationally)

  Experts have warned about the risk that if tough measures are taken too soon, “fatigue” may set in, prompting the public to disregard the advice just as the virus reaches its peak.


Effectively the argument is that, absent some sort of enforcement squad if people are told to stay in lockdown for a significant period, without a significant scare factor to justify it, then people will assume the risk is actually overblown and start mingling again, just at the moment that many of them are at their most contagious, starting a whole new outbreak in the herd of uninfected.

  US President Donald Trump has announced sweeping new travel restrictions on Europe in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
  
  In a televised address, he said travel from 26 European countries would be suspended for the next 30 days.
  
  But he said the ""strong but necessary"" restrictions would not apply to the UK, where 460 cases of the virus have now been confirmed.
  
  [...]
  
  Mr Trump said the European Union had ""failed to take the same precautions"" as the US in fighting the virus.
  
  A Presidential Proclamation, published shortly after Mr Trump's address, specified that the ban applies to anyone who has been in the EU's Schengen border-free area within 14 days prior to their arrival in the US.


N.B. additional reasons given in the US proclamation:


  The administration’s European travel proclamation notes that “the Schengen Area has exported 201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries. Moreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult.”

  #Europe is taking all necessary measures to contain the spread of the #COVID19 virus, limit the number of affected people and support research.

  here doesn't support that.

  it is now likely that it will spread more significantly.

4627,50920,Is a WHO PHEIC declaration per-area/per-country or is it always of global effect?,"Wikipedia lets us know that:


  A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action"". Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.
  
  [...]
  
  On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC. [...]


It's unclear to me from that if a WHO PHEIC declaration (and thus the obligations following from that) are limited to an area or country that the WHO decides ""to PHEIC"" or is a PHEIC declaration on some concern, e.g. this-or-that-disease ""is PHEIC'd"" automatically entails that all IHR member countries have to respond similarly, e.g. report [all] cases of that disease. So what's the (geographical) scope of a PHEIC? Does the WHO have the latitude to ""customize it""?
",50926,"A PHEIC declaration does not apply to a specific area - it is just that, a declaration by the WHO that the Directory-General has determined that a public health emergency of international concern exists pursuant to Article 12 of the International Health Regulation (2005). Paragraph 5 of Article 12 states that


  If the Director-General, following consultations with the State Party
  within whose territory the public health emergency of international
  concern has occurred, considers that a public health emergency of
  international concern has ended, the Director-General shall take a
  decision in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 49.


Paragraph 6 of Article 49 states that 


  The Director-General shall communicate to States Parties the
  determination and the termination of a public health emergency of
  international concern, any health measure taken by the State Party
  concerned, any temporary recommendation, and the modification,
  extension and termination of such recommendations, together with the
  views of the Emergency Committee.


Here, States Parties refers to all state parties to the IHR - so any declaration of a PHEIC is therefore applicable globally, and obligates state parties to notify the WHO of any local spread of the disease. Notably, the declaration of a disease to be a PHEIC does not actually introduce new obligations to state parties directly, but as states are required under Article 6 to


  notify WHO, by the most efficient means of communication available, by
  way of the National IHR Focal Point, and within 24 hours of assessment
  of public health information, of all events which may constitute a
  public health emergency of international concern within its territory
  in accordance with the decision instrument, as well as any health
  measure implemented in response to those events


the designation of the disease to be a PHEIC means that the event is notifiable, and as a result, the declaration of a PHEIC affects all state parties by definition.

However, if we refer back to Article 49, note that the Director-General is obligated to communicate temporary recommendations with regard to public health. These temporary recommendations are non-binding and time-limited, and are described further in Article 15, paragraph 2 of which states that


  Temporary recommendations may include health measures to be
  implemented by the State Party experiencing the public health
  emergency of international concern, or by other States Parties,
  regarding persons, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods
  and/or postal parcels to prevent or reduce the international spread of
  disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic.


Therefore, these temporary recommendations need not be globally applicable, and can apply to just one, or a few state parties.

In conclusion then, while the declaration of a PHEIC is applicable globally, the temporary recommendations issued as a result of the declaration are not required to be, and in general, aren't.

Many comments from EU leader seem to assume that this is a political decision rather than a health-based decision, especially with regard to this exception.

Is there any official rationale for this exception?
",50944,"The official rationale, according to Trump's presidential proclamation, is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could become overwhelmed ""if sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus occurred in the United States on a large scale"". It continues:


  The World Health Organization has determined that multiple countries
  within the Schengen Area are experiencing sustained person-to-person
  transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
  
  [...]
  
  The Schengen Area currently has the largest number of confirmed
  COVID-19 cases outside of the People’s Republic of China.  As of March
  11, 2020, the number of cases in the 26 Schengen Area countries is
  17,442, with 711 deaths, and shows high continuous growth in infection
  rates.  In total, as of March 9, 2020, the Schengen Area has exported
  201 COVID-19 cases to 53 countries.  Moreover, the free flow of people
  between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the
  spread of the virus difficult.
  
  The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and
  monitor all of the travelers continuing to arrive from the Schengen
  Area.  The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by
  infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the
  Schengen Area threatens the security of our transportation system and
  infrastructure and the national security.  Given the importance of
  protecting persons within the United States from the threat of this
  harmful communicable disease, I have determined that it is in the
  interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend
  the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of
  all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during
  the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the
  United States.


The reasoning exposed in the proclamation, then, is that due to the lack of travel restrictions between Schengen countries, it is far harder to manage the spread of the disease by controlling inter-Schengen migration. This factor is attributed by the proclamation as the main cause of community spread throughout the 26 member countries, and even goes as far as to tacitly blame the international spread of the disease on the area.

At a practical level, consider someone arriving to the USA from Slovenia, a member of the Schengen area. While Slovenia itself only has 31 cases currently, it is impossible for USA immigration officials to tell whether that person has just driven from Italy, which has over 10,000 cases. As a result, the Trump administration seems to have decided that the best way to deal with this issue is a blanket ban (with some exceptions, e.g. US citizens, travellers invited by the US to aid efforts against Covid-19 etc. See proclamation for full details) on travel from the Schengen area countries and visitors who have visited the area within the last 14 days, the incubation period of the disease.

Travellers from a non-Schengen area, however, seem to be presumed to be able to prove that they haven't been in any Schengen countries in the last 14 days by their passport records, and as such the level of risk they pose should be able to  be more easily evaluated.

However, as pointed out in the comments, inter-European travel does not involve passport stamping in some cases, for example from Italy to the UK, so it will be difficult to identify these travellers practically. It is unclear how immigration officials will mitigate this.

The reasoning of the proclamation, however, remains that travel restrictions could be easily imposed between, to use our example, Italy and the UK, meaning that travellers from the UK are lower risk.

Update 14/03: The travel ban has now been extended to the UK and Ireland, which calls into question the original official rationale, but does not change it.

casino billionaire and Israel activist. In 2016, he
donated $25m
to the Trump campaign.

Adelson is an opponent to the two-state solution. Among other things,
he has
claimed
that ""the Palestinians are an invented people,"" that ""the purpose of
the existence of Palestinians is to destroy Israel"" and that
a Palestinian state is a
""a steppingstone for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people.""
Adelson also bankrolls the
Heritage Foundation a conservative public
policy think tank that opposes
Palestinian statehood
and favors the
three-state solution.

So if one state is out, due to the ""demographic suicide""
angle, two-states, because Palestinians want to destroy Israel, then the only option left is three states.

4631,50968,What are the details of the Federal Reserve's $1.5 trillion injection?,"According to the Wall Street Journal, in order to attempt to slow the economic contraction caused by the Covid-19 virus, the Federal Reserve has promised to inject $1.5 trillion into the economy, by


  [making] vast sums of short-term loans available on Wall Street and
  [purchasing] Treasury securities in a coronavirus-related response aimed
  at preventing ominous trading conditions from creating a sharper
  economic contraction.


How can such a large sum of money be allocated to this without any debate or official order by the government? Where does this money come from? And how does providing loans to Wall Street help prevent the economy from contracting further?
",50971,"There's no loan here. What is happening is a buyback to inject money into the system (emphasis mine)


  Today the Fed announced a $1.5 trillion liquidity provision to the interbank lending market — primarily in the form of “repurchase agreements.” The interbank lending market comprises the federal-funds market (in which the Fed actively participates on a daily basis) and the repurchase-agreement (or “repo”) market (in which the Fed intervenes primarily when there is a lack of liquidity). In the repo market, one financial institution temporarily trades securities to another institution, with the understanding that it will repurchase those securities in the near future (usually the next day). Banks with large balance sheets often need access to quick cash to conduct regular operations, and the most practical way to get that cash is through repos. Otherwise, managing their balance sheets would be needlessly onerous. 


And


  [The Federal Reserve] is engaging in short-term transactions with banks to ensure financial stability. If the Fed bought your house today and sold it back to you tomorrow, it wouldn’t be doing you a huge favor. The Fed’s intervention in the repo market, while a boon to the U.S. financial system, is far from a handout. 

",Accepted,"If you consider CO2 emission as the source of climate change, then only a reduction of CO2 emission can be the ultimate solution to the problem.
Thus, emitting less CO2 is the goal. However, some fields lend themselves more to CO2 reduction than others. While it is relatively straight forward to replace cars with internal combustion engines with electric vehicles; electricity generation can be switches only in a much larger time frame. Whereas e.g. steel production will turn out to be a very tricky one. You simply can't run a blast furnace with electricity.

That is where the technologies which focus on recyling or storage of CO2 come into play. If you can't stop a blast furnace from emitting CO2, you can capture the CO2 and do something, e.g. turn it into other chemicals.

However, in total more CO2 reduction is achieved by not emitting the CO2 in the first place.

The article mentions only this rather general and vague reason for holding them:


  Macron decided to go ahead with the elections last week, saying it was
  vital the democratic system to continue functioning.


Clearly holding an elections means that lots of people are walking around and since the coronavirus spreads much easier that other viruses, it kind of defeats the purpose of existing restrictions.

Isn't it possible to delay elections in France?

Also, it is expected that voter turnout to be lower due to people being afraid of going out.

Question: Why did the French government organized elections as planned in spite of coronavirus restrictions?
",51011,"Scientists advising the government told them that, with appropriate measures (such as soap everywhere, >1m distance between everyone, etc.), it was no more dangerous than going to buy some food, which is still authorized. The full scientific advice has not been published yet (it should be though), but here is the head of the scientific committee confirming it :


  Le conseil scientifique a considéré qu’il n’y avait pas d’élément
  pour penser qu’il y aurait un surrisque pour ces personnes à condition
  que les élections soient organisées de façon pratique
  
  The scientific committee considered there was no element indicating
  more risk [to go vote than to go shopping] for those people [elderly
  people], if the elections are organized in a practical way.


There is also a question of politics and timing : on Thursday morning all parties asked that it be maintained (in particular the right-wing Senate president, who is now blamed for it), so they had to decide that. 
However, later the same day, the confinement measures were decided, which seemed to contradict the possibility to vote. But politically it was too late, cancelling the elections would go against advice given by all parties on Thursday morning. 
Since Macron was expected to lose the elections (which he mostly did), cancelling the election after every other party expressed against it would have been seen as an antidemocratic political maneuver.

Some of the opposition parties have since then declared that they only accepted to maintain the elections before the confinement measures were decided, and thus that they could not decide in all knowledge, and would have changed their minds after the confinement measures were announced.

China has also been criticised for its initial response to the virus, which the Financial Times describes as a ""cover-up"", and which US national security advisor Robert O'Brien says ""cost the world community two months"" in terms of preparation for the disease. This would appear to be in breach of the International Health Regulations (2005), Article 6 of which states that:


  Each State Party shall notify WHO, by the most efficient means of
  communication available, by way of the National IHR Focal Point, and
  within 24 hours of assessment of public health information, of all
  events which may constitute a public health emergency of international
  concern within its territory


Given the criticisms above, does the World Health Organization have any powers to either enforce health recommendations such as quarantines or lockdowns, powers to punish or sanction countries that refuse to comply with said health recommendations, or powers to punish countries that breach their obligations under the IHR?

I have been able to find this article which describes a panel which investigated this in the wake of the ebola crisis, but I can't find more information about the results of this investigation.

  WHO officials have criticised the UK government's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic


Actually the quoted criticism does not come from the WHO, nor from a current employee of the WHO. It comes from 


  Professor Anthony Costello, ex-director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organisation


The criticism is of the claim that the UK government should


  ""just let 60% of the population get it""


These appear to be the words of a radio presenter not a published policy of the UK government.

The UK's Health Secretary recently said Herd immunity is not the policy of the UK government.


  “Herd immunity is not our policy. It’s not our goal. Our goal is to protect life and our policy is to fight the virus and protect the vulnerable and protect the NHS. And that’s what we’re doing. Now there is a, of course there’s a scientific debate around scientific concepts, but I want to be absolutely crystal clear that we will do what is necessary to protect life,”


So the premise is questionable.



The subject of herd immunity and the 60% figure came from an interview with the chief scientific adviser to the UK government. He was apparently speaking about the conditions for a potential resurgence of COVID-19 next winter and beyond. 




  Does the World Health Organization have the power to impose sanctions?


Not really, not of the sort the question seems to suggest.

The WHO did impose sanctions on a news-media organisation that leaked information in advance of a publication date. WHO banned the organisation from its press conferences for two weeks.

Any UN member state can apply for membership of the WHO. It seems likely the WHO can, as a sanction, expel a member from the WHO. I suspect only the UN itself could expel a state from the UN.

In the past, the WHO has been associated with criticisms of punitive sanctions on countries as hampering the objectives of the WHO. The WHO seems to generally aim to assist rather than punish countries.

Like any individual or organization, the WHO can advocate for or against a sanction. As a UN specialized agency it is likely to be listened to by the UN assemblies. As I understand it, it does not have the power itself to commit the UN to sanctions.

It is normally UN member states who would apply and enforce punitive sanctions following a resolution of the UN security council of which the UK is a permanent member with veto rights.

4762,51038,Why do Western countries seem to be less efficient than Asian countries in fighting against COVID-19?,"So far it appears that Western countries especially in Europe (e.g. Italy, Spain, UK, France, Germany) struggle to curb the spread of COVID-19. This is in contrast to most Asian countries (China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore) which were hit by the virus earlier, but managed to reduce the contagion through drastic containment measures.

While it's probably too soon to evaluate the effect of the strong measures which have been implemented in the past few days in many European countries, it looks as if Western countries have been reluctant and/or unable and/or inefficient at implementing the methods used in Asia to fight the contagion. It also looks as if Asian countries are expected to be more disciplined and/or organized than Western countries (example).

Are there any objective reasons why Western countries are less efficient than Asian countries in the fight against COVID-19?

Added: For example, are there different political choices which were made before and during the outbreak? Are there structural differences, for instance in the way governments can deploy resources in a crisis? 
",51040,"Part of it is going to be that the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.

Also, it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.

Japan?  It's relatively unscathed so far, but it is an isolated island, with comparatively few foreigners which isn't on great terms with its Asian neighbors.  As @bobsburner mentioned, ""travel density"" counts for a great deal with covid-19.  For now - counting it as luck, might become skill later.  Or its success might just be down to not-testing, as @steros says.

Supply chains are in Asia.  This is being shown as an Achilles' heel of Western service-oriented economies:  if we need to ramp production of electronic testing kits or ventilators, we are cut off from a lot of the world's manufacturing capacity.

Collectivism vs. individualism has a part to play in it as well:  it's more difficult for a Western politician to push drastic measures like quarantine (let alone China's dictatorial system).  Still, Italy was pretty quick to do so, because they had no choice.  Still, the cultural traits leading to quick acceptance by the community of harsh limitations on individual liberties seems to be an Asian advantage at this point:

Here's a Medical Sciences Stack Exchange answer re. isolation, testing and surveillance procedures followed in Guangdong, near HK, so not Wuhan at all.  An article partly covering Wuhan itself.  And we've heard of the one-week hospitals.  We're just not there yet, in terms of mobilization. Or coercion.

Constant deficit spending.  A country like Italy is at 130%+ GDP debt.  They've resisted pressure to shape up their finances, tax collection, pension payments, etc... for decades.  They just don't have anything left to surge spending in emergencies.  This applies to just too many European economies.

It's also really too early to say much about the final outcome.  Currently South Korea and China are better at getting the disease under control, but what really counts is the long run.  If a few dozen people in Wuhan spread the disease rapidly in January then we need to be ready to wait this out for a while - ""social distancing &amp; quarantines"" for 3 months, then relaxing will result in restarted epidemics.

There's also, esp. at the start, plain luck.  The 2003 SARS epidemic hit Canada's west coast less than Toronto, because a doctor got bad vibes about a patient with breathing problems and she isolated them, before any outbreak was known.  In Toronto the same type of cases mingled with the general hospital staff and patients and the outbreak was much worse.  In Italy 1 covid case was not identified as such and went to the hospital 4 times, interacting with everyone else.  S. Korea had a massive cluster early on, but it was within a religious sect, which might interact less with others.

It's hard to really assign a ""good vs bad"" label to early spread.  Past that, the quality of political leaders and their ability to balance out economic/social reality vs medical advice (which is still operating in uncertainty - witness the UK's ""herd"" approach) is going to be key.  This is a good time to be listening to experts, and there some of the Asian technocrats are a definite better bet than some of the West's populists.  I know I wouldn't be thrilled to have Duterte in the Philippines in charge, for example, and he's Asian.

Rather than competition and comparisons, it might be useful to see what has been achieved so far:  to some extent S. Korea and China have shown that aggressive testing and quarantines can slow the disease, Australia was very quick to sequence the bug's genome, we got a test within weeks! and some Western countries are starting to look at and evaluate candidate vaccines.  We are much better off in 2020 than if SARS had had that kind of punch in 2003.
",Accepted,"I can't give you a precise answer because we lack a lot of basic information, but there's a hypothesis which is worth some consideration.

COVID-19 was detected the first of December 2019, but at a fish market that couldn't possibly be the source of the new strain, it means that the virus was already going around for an unknown amount of time. Two more months passed before China decided a lockdown. So much time passed that it is possible that the epidemic was close to its peak and that most of the people were infected and had already developed the antibodies. Therefore your assumption you base the question on, that the Western countries are struggling more than China, might not be correct.

Edit:

I see that you changed your title and you changed the assumption from the Western countries struggling more than China to the Asian countries that seem to be more efficient than the European countries. This changes the subject and the meaning of my answer. While the previous assumption was dubious, but more precise, the second is confused and full of implications difficult to prove: 

When you say that Asian countries seem to be more efficient are you implying that all of them where affected in the same way and reacted in the same way? There is an enormous amount of differences among them. Japan and South Korea contained the spread more easily. But why? Did they interacted more with Chinese people coming from other regions? Was it due to better weather conditions? Was it due to the hygienic conditions that already existed there independently from the epidemic? There are a lot of variables here. But then How can you relate Japan with a country like India where the hygiene condition are worse, but the weather conditions are a lot more difficult for a virus like an influenza?

Furthermore we know almost nothing about what happened and what is happening in countries like Iran, does your question also imply that Iran seem to be more efficient than Western countries?

4764,51090,Why are Central Banks cutting interest rates in response to COVID-19?,"Central Banks around the world have cut interest rates in the past few days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the US Federal Reserve (0-0.25%), the Bank of England (0.1%), and the Reserve Bank of Australia (0.25%). Notably, the European Central Bank has not yet cut interest rates further, but this is partly because it is already in the negatives, at -0.5%.

Why are central banks taking this measure in response to this pandemic in particular - i.e. how does this measure lessen the pandemic's economic impact - and what are the impacts on the average consumer of a cut in their country's central bank interest rate in general?
",51096,"By lowering interest rates the Fed's main goal is to prop up the stock market, and support US corporations.

This is achieved through the following effects:
- it encourages credit creation through bank lending, and because most money originates in credit it makes money cheaper and more widely available
- it lowers the rates of return on savings and thus encourages savers to spend more freely, which has a twofold effect: it stimulates the economy into the creation of yet more loans, and it tells savers to go elsewhere with their money

The resulting availability of money/credit and lowered bank savings rates makes the stock market an attractive destination.

Since 2007, the financial crisis, the Fed is essentially a hostage of the stock market in that if now must keep loose monetary policy to further the illusion of perpetual long term stock market gains. This is further evidenced by the tentative and then aborted QT (quantitive tightening) attempt last year. 

In the current climate of coronavirus economic meltdown, the lowered interest rate has a further goal: to help protect US corporations who are now overstretched on corporate bonds.

Since 2007, unbeknownst to many, and I think illegal outside the US (?) , corporations  - rather than restructure in the wake of the crisis - regularly take advantage of the cheap money stimulus by issuing corporate bonds (essentially borrowing money at low rates) so that their execs can use this to direct the company to purchase its own stock on the stock market. This creates the illusion of rising corporate value while allowing shareholders to receive big dividends and CEOs to pay themselves income related bonuses.

This irresponsible corporate behaviour has brought US corporations to the point that the coronavirus meltdown has slowed earnings below what they need to pay on the corporate bonds. Without direct government support many US corporations will go bust, and corporate bond prices will plummet, which will trigger further meltdown in financial institutions that invest in those assets.

Again, silently under the media radar, just this week the US (?) and ECB created new funds that will be directed to supply money to those institutions buying corporate bonds. To be clear, the way that works is that bondholders who are now nervous about the corporation defaulting might not roll over their bond....rather than reacquiring bonds at the end of their term, or even ending prematurely, they will demand their money from the corps. The corps. don't have it, but new bonds will be sold to the govt backed funds. (Once again the taxpayer bails out the fatcat)

So in summary, the reduced interest rate in combo with new funds, is designed to prop up the stock market and corporations to prevent socioeconomic collapse.

Around the world, central banks lower the rate for the effects of stimulus and stock market prop-up described above. ECB does not lower because the negative interest rate actually makes loans more expensive in some cases as being paid to borrow makes it easier than to lend.

Greece, currently the second most indebted nation, went through a decade-long debt crisis after the 2008 financial crash. It entered this crisis with debt levels of 'only' 103% of GDP, and over the entire debt crisis, this only increased to 181% of GDP.

How is Japan able to withstand this level of debt without entering a debt crisis similar to Greece? Is this the right metric to look at, or are there other factors specific to either country?
",51105,"Their economies are radically different otherwise.


Greece has a weak economy in most fields, with the exception of tourism.  Japan is a manufacturing and scientific powerhouse.
Greece runs recurring high deficits and had rarely, if ever, shown inclination to stop doing so.  While Japan was criticized at the start of their financial decline for insisting on balanced budgets instead of stimulating demand.
Tax collection.  Japan does it.  Greece didn't.
Japan could devaluate its currency if necessary to adjust its finances.  Greece couldn't, being on the euro.
Japanese government debt is, I believe, mostly owed to Japanese investors and denominated in yen, unlike Greece's.
Japan has demonstrated for decades that it can pay its bills, on its own.  Greece on the other hand just seemed as if the only thing that kept it up was euro membership.
Greek official statistics were not, and had not for a while, been trusted.  They're still prosecuting the guy who showed they were cooking the books.


Until 2008, Greece was only getting charged a 0.25% point premium over German bonds based on the tacit assumption that Europe (Euro-zone) would never let Greece go broke. Investors, out of greed and risk un-awareness (or trust in European taxpayers gullibility), parked their money in Greek bonds, rather than German ones, just to get that extra 0.25% point.

From https://www.bankofgreece.gr/Publications/Annrep1999.pdf (I find it hard to set hard time limits on Google to only look at stuff from before a date):


  Specifically, the yield differential between the Greek and the German 10-year
  bond fell from roughly 270 basis points at end-1998 to about 200 basis points in March
  1999 (see Chart VI.1).


At the start of the general crisis, investors started wondering if trusting that Europe would always back Greek debt, even when undergoing a Europe-wide crisis, was a wise idea.  Once perception soured, the game was up very quickly.  Financing costs for Greek government debt went up, fast.  Any refinancing happened at progressively higher rates.  A debt that looked bad at the previous, lower, rate seemed like it would result in a short term default.  People still loaned to Greece, but the premium to do so was massive and made this very quickly unsustainable.

The plug was pulled, late high-rate private and non-European investors got a haircut.  Europe's taxpayers paid up enough money for Greece to keep paying slightly lowered interests, at deferred times, to the big German and French banks so they wouldn't take too massive a loss (and so that loss of confidence wouldn't spread, as per @Machavity answer).

Most Greek debt remained in place, unlike what happens in say an Argentinian default.  In fact, money ""helpfully"" loaned to keep Greece from defaulting on interest payments just got added to the overall debt.  In a way, though it fully deserved the initial mess it got, that's the tragedy of Greece.  Instead of the reset that comes with a default, Greeks got this unending misery of servicing a debt which is only pretended to be fully recoverable from (as most of my post is critical, I want to stress that, IMHO, the Greek people don't deserve to live through this for decades).

But no one is too willing to put their hands in that wolf's jaws anymore.

As o.m. says, mostly perception. Until COVID-19 at least, Japan looks like it has a few good years left for investors, most of whom are Japanese and have little interest in rocking the boat.  This is not to say it is financially healthy, only that it is under less external pressure.

Greece relies on foreign money, didn't look good in 2008 and doesn't now.  In most other conditions, big chunks of that 181% would have been written off as unrecoverable already.

I wonder about the motivations of this decision: buying a newspaper is not essential by any definition of the term. Television, radio and internet are largely sufficient to cover the need for information of the general population.

Is there a reasonable political explanation for this? At first sight, it seems that the only one is the ties and the balance of power between politicians and news outlets / medias.
",51109,"At least in Italy, this appears to be in part a response to pressure from newspapers and their readers. On March 11th, the director of la Repubblica newspaper Carlo Verdelli published (in Italian) an article asking for newsagents to be included in the list of essential services, saying that ""The list is missing a service that is more fundamental 
 now than ever before, that of information"". He went on to state that ""If [newsagents] were not included in the list, it would cause irreparable damage, not only for newspapers, but most importantly for the citizenry."" (my translation)

This is an important point, as a study undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that while TV and online media dominate, 31% of Italians and 23% of French adults get their news from print media at least daily. This group is likely to be composed of older citizens who will be most affected if they contract the virus, and although this puts them at more risk if they leave their houses to buy a newspaper, it is of higher importance to keep at-risk groups informed. 

In addition, another Pew Research Center study found that newspapers were especially important for coverage of local news that would not otherwise be reported in alternative media - although the study was limited to the US, this is another potential factor that could have influenced the decision.

It seems that France and Italy have decided that informing the populace is especially important in this time of crisis, and that this outweighs the threat public health and the potential spread of disease that the inclusion of newsagents as an essential service poses.
",Accepted,"There are probably several reasons for the Russian government to be making these claims. Obvious possibilities include: 

They're talking to the Russian population, not the rest of the world

The Russian economy is not doing well, so it's worth focussing the population's attention on external threats. This will tend to distract them from discontent over their living conditions, the steady concentration of power and wealth in the government and its immediate allies, and so on. 

We don't know how healthy the Russian strategic deterrent is

The government is short of money, but they have a lot of missiles to maintain.

It's a negotiating strategy

If they make a fuss about a missile defence system, they might be able to get some concession in exchange for accepting it. 

The Russians don't regard the Iranian threat as credible

The missile defence systems installed in Poland a decade ago were explicitly for defence against Iranian missiles. The Russians didn't regard that threat as credible, mainly because they feel that the Iranian government is somewhat rational and capable of being deterred by US strategic weapons, and by French and UK SLBMs. 

So they don't see any threat that that the missile defence system could be used against, apart from Russia. 

They suspect the missile defence system can be rapidly strengthened

One claimed reason why the missile defence system ""can't be intended for use against Russia"" is that the numbers of missiles are too small to make a significant difference. However, rapid production of weaponry has been an American speciality in the past. The present-day procurement system is quite inefficient, but that could be changed.

In addition, it is not only those outlets, but other governmental organizations like the WHO that have advised against dubbing COVID-19 in such a manner.

In the past we have had cases where a widespread global epidemic has also been referred to other countries or nationalities, such as:

The ""Russian Flu"" or ""Asiatic Flu""
The Japanese Smallpox Epidemic
The Asian Flu and the Hong Kong Flu
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has been referred to as Saudi Arabia's SARS-like virus.


In any case, is the media backlash over Trump's nickname for COVID-19 justifiably warranted? Is there a problem in the way COVID-19 has been nicknamed?
",51122,"Let's appreciate the learning curve. The problem with all of those historical names is that they created sharp spikes in prejudice, social ostracism, and violence against the indicated groups, and still create issues today as seen here with COVID-19. It's true that the first identified cases of Covid-19 occurred in Wuhan China, but this does not imply that people of Chinese descent — or even people recently emigrated from China — are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. But in the minds of an unfortunate number of ignorant people, the mere association of the disease with Chinese heritage can produce verbal and physical assaults, and/or other social pressures that can prevent Chinese people in any walk of life from getting access to necessities or essential services. 

Trump's very public insistence on calling this the 'Chinese virus', backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of Asian descent (whether or not they are specifically Chinese). It guarantees this merely by giving an authoritative affirmation to the most panicked, emotional, and ignorant portion of our society that those 'Chinese' are in some way responsible for the spread of Covid-19.

No doubt Trump does this intentionally. Trump thrives on the panicked, angry ignorance of others; that emotional state he knows how to manipulate to his own profit. And while he himself may not be concerned with the secondary impact of increased violence against people of Asian descent, people of Asian descent have a good deal to worry about.

A president ought to have the presence of mind not to inflame racial tensions in a situation where tensions are already running exceedingly high. Even if we wanted to argue that there is nothing terribly wrong with the phrasing in and of itself — that it's just a poor choice of words by a man whom no one considers to be eloquent, perhaps — misstatements by someone who is (ostensibly) the leader of the free world have significant consequences. If even one Asian American gets attacked because of someone emboldened by Trump's poor word choice, that is blood on Trump's hands.

  No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.


There is no official time limit on how long this can take. Historically, the fastest amendment was the 26th, which took 100 days, while the slowest was the 27th, taking more than 200 years. Wikipedia has a nice table which includes the timing of amendments in the past.

Practically speaking, the amendment process is complicated enough that an amendment is unlikely to pass quickly in order to help a particular candidate.

In the specific case of the Democrats trying to do it right now in 2019, it's not possible. Proposing an amendment requires two thirds of both houses of Congress or two thirds of the legislatures of the states. Democrats do not control two thirds of either house, nor do they control two thirds of state legislatures. This means that Democrats, acting alone, cannot propose any Constitutional amendments at this time. Actually ratifying an amendment requires three fourths of the state legislatures or conventions in three fourths of the states, an even higher bar that likewise won't be met. Neither party has the kind of supermajority required to pass amendments that the other party doesn't support.

4904,51124,How did the US administration usually refer to COVID-19 before the Chinese foreign ministry started claiming the virus is of US origin?,"It's been recently reported that Trump's administration (Trump himself, but also Pompeo) has been referring to COVID-19 as ""China virus"" or ""Wuhan coronavirus"" etc., emphasizing the Chinese origin of the virus, despite the WHO's recommendations against using such geographical labelling.

The Trump administration says they are doing this (now) to combat (apparently recent) Chinese propaganda that the COVID-19 was introduced by the US Army to Wuhan during a (friendly) visit. (An accusation for which, I have to say, the Chinese political officials presented no real evidence, and which seems to contradict even what the Chinese scientists have been saying about the same issue.)

How did the US administration (top officials) usually refer to COVID-19 before the Chinese foreign ministry started to make such (unsupported) accusations (i.e. roughly before March 12)?
",51134,"Usually, the Trump administration referred to the virus as ""coronavirus"", ""the coronavirus"", or, more commonly in press releases and official documents, the official WHO name of  ""COVID-19"". The response team headed by VP Mike Pence was termed the ""Coronavirus Task Force"", for example.

There are however, instances prior to March 12th, when the allegations were tweeted by a Chinese official for the first time, where a location was attached to the disease. 

As far back as the start of February, White House chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow described the virus as ""the Chinese virus"" in an interview with Fox Business Network.

Mike Pompeo and Republican Senators &amp; Representatives repeatedly used the term ""Wuhan Virus"" in press briefings and in debates in the weeks leading up to the 12th. On the 9th, GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted a link to the CDC website, saying that it offered ""Everything you need to know about the Chinese coronavirus"".

On March 10th, Trump retweeted a tweet by Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, which calls the virus ""China Virus"" and says that ""the US stands a chance if we can control of our borders""(sic). In his address on March 11th which announced the travel ban to Schengen countries, Trump described the disease as a ""foreign virus"".

It should be noted that this is not specific to the Trump administration, indeed, before March, many media outlets also included a geographic adjective in their reporting, including the BBC, the Guardian, Al Jazeera, the Financial Times, Reuters, Scientific American, the Associated Press, the Global Times, and the Washington Post, amongst others. This term then fell out of use towards the end of February, as this analysis by Axios shows, being replaced by the WHO sanctioned terms. 

In conclusion, then, while US administration officials usually used the term ""coronavirus"", or the medical term ""COVID-19"", there was significant use of a geographic adjective, be that ""China"", ""Chinese"", or ""Wuhan"". While this was not initially exclusive to conservative politicians or administration officials, in the last couple of weeks in response to many claims that the term is racist, offensive, and inaccurate, this language has become far less popular, and now is used in the US almost solely by Republican officials &amp; conservative media outlets, and has become far more frequently used by these individuals.

",51156,"Official infection and death numbers tend to rely on reports accumulated through several layers of bureaucracy, often with daily reports at several levels. A hospital reports the numbers to the city administration, they are added up and sent to the province, and those are added up and sent to the national level. So the actual reporting period is not the day when the statistic was published, it is when the base data was collected. That tends to be in the fine print, what news and spokespeople care about is the relative change from the previous reporting period.

You can find the tracker from Johns Hopkins which tends to exceed official national figures because they take local statements and add them up in realtime, rather than waiting for the official reports to arrive.

",Accepted,"The dominant American Foreign policy is some variation of ""The Monroe Doctrine"" which is best summed up as ""If you want to start trouble, you are not starting it here."" And the military has largely been set up to enforce this.  In the early days, this was quite easy as America really only had to maintain a small military force to counter European and Native American threats on the mainland, both were not to powerful... and if war broke out, reinforcements were difficult to get to the Americas before the US could increase its own forces.  The U.S. Civil war still remains the bloodiest war fought in the hemisphere with Gettysburg being the biggest battle in the hemisphere to date.

Up until the end of WWII, the United States had only ever participated in a war as a defender nation (or presumed defender when they made the declaration, such as the Spanish-American War).  The reigning political thought was ""It's not our problem unless they make it our problem.""  This changed with the cold war as Communism was deemed antithetical to the American ideals and had a mission statement of global communism.  The US invested heavily in preventing the spread, which was the goal of political Communist thinking.  Again, this isn't so much opposed to Monroe Doctrine as the goal was preventing Communism from reaching the Americas.  It's telling that the closest the U.S. ever got to declaring Nuclear War was when Russia started deploying Nukes to Cuba and the nation collectively lost its mind.

The US was able to ultimately win in while they had an irrational fear of the Communism, The Soviet Union had a very rational fear of the United States.  After all, they are the only nation to use a nuclear weapon in war.  And we didn't really hate the Japanese people's way of life when we were in that war.  But we hated Communism.

So the U.S. kept up military spending to scare off a Soviet Attack... and the Soviet Union tried to keep up with us.  (The Soviets never had the edge in the ""Bomber Gap"" and only briefly had it in the ""Missile Gap"" but they were much better at hiding this and had the U.S. convinced they had better missiles and more bombers than the U.S. did).  It became a game of chicken that eventually forced the Soviet Union into defeat as they couldn't keep up with U.S. spending, having been hit by several food shortages, the Afghanistan War, and Chernobyl.

This strategy has actually been able to protect the most important asset in the US military arsenal:  The Troops, very well.  In it's entire history which doesn't have a lack of war in it, The United States has lost about 2.7 million to casualties of War (Both wounded and unable to fight and killed) in its entire history.  Compare with the Soviet Union, which had lost about 2.9 million people to non-death related causalities in WWII alone.  By these numbers the United States is expected to lose an annual average 11,500 people to Death of War, which sounds like a lot, except that the average rate of deaths from civilian automobile accidents is around 40,000 per year in the US.

The U.S. Public wants to the military to do two things:  Keep the enemies ""over there"" where they belong and to send home as few of their troops in boxes as possible.  To do this, they are willing to put more money into the military than similarly developed nations.

As mentioned in comments, this has also meant that a large portion of the US economy is driven by the military.  In fact, it's not uncommon for entire communities to become Ghost Towns when the local military base is closed down for budget reasons.

4906,51159,What are the objections to Mitch McConnell's COVID-19 Bill?,"In the US Senate on Sunday, March 22nd, Democrats blocked the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in a 47-47 vote that was split along party lines. McConnell indicated that he would try to pass the bill again on Monday, ostensibly so that Senators could see how markets would react to the lack of financial measures so far:


  We're going to vote at 9:45 in the morning (1345 GMT) ... 15 minutes
  after the markets open and see whether there's a change of heart,


This timing was not agreed to, with the debate continuing later in the day than planned, seemingly with no further bilateral progress made.

The first article also notes that Democrats ""decried the Republican proposal as prioritising the needs of Wall Street and corporate America over those of average people."", and would ""benefit corporate interests at the expense of hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states"". Senator Elizabeth Warren, until recently a 2020 presidential candidate, told reporters that ""We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family, or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends"".

The summary of the bill, however, states that it provides funding for small businesses and individuals, which would seem to benefit the average person, and includes a raft of healthcare provisions, including ""additional funding for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19"", and ""limits [on] liability for volunteer health care professionals"" in order to help fight the disease.

Which provisions in the bill specifically are opponents of the bill objecting to? Which measures are seen as benefiting corporate America over individuals?
",51162,"Democrats have been trying to make the case that the stimulus package contains within it a corporate ""slush fund"" controlled by the Treasury Department and headed by Steve Mnuchin, and Democrats believe there is a high risk of mismanagement or outright corruption. From NYMag:


  The central flash point concerns a $500 billion corporate bailout. [...] 
  Its requirements that bailed-out firms protect their workers are too weak. (Protecting the workers is the whole rationale for bailing them out, after all — at least from the Democrats’ point of view.) More disturbing, it’s designed as a pool of money to be doled out by the Treasury secretary. That is to say, the money is, for all intents and purposes, personally controlled by Donald Trump, who selected the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and could replace him on a whim. [...]
  One obvious outcome of this financing arrangement would be to create the all-but-certain outcome that the Treasury would select the Trump Organization as one of the worthy recipients of its largesse. Trump’s vacation properties have indeed been forced to shut down, and while an unbiased manager might not select the Trump Organization over needier coronavirus victims, Trump himself probably thinks differently. Indeed, at his press conference, the president did not even bring himself to deny that he might. “Let’s just see what happens,” he replied, as if the outcome might contain any mystery.


They also make the argument that the restrictions on the bailout fund that are in place to prevent some of the excesses by executives after the bailout of 2008 are weak, as are protections for workers who become unemployed. From Politico:


  According to a senior Democratic aide, the party's concerns with the GOP proposal center on $500 billion for corporations; stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury secretary; only a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits; and no provisions to protect individuals from eviction. [...] Democrats also object to what they say is an insufficient amount of money for state and local governments and providing only three months of unemployment insurance. Democrats initially asked for $750 billion in state aid, and Republicans have countered with far less.


A further complication for the bill is the behavior by many of these firms and how they chose to spend money saved by the GOP tax cut. Instead of using that money to create rainy day funds, they instead used that money to repurchase stock in order to inflate executive compensation to the detriment of their workers.

Bills of Attainder can take several forms. One common example form is an administrative (Executive Branch; state or federal) regulation that proffers an adhesion contract to an individual which provides for penalty (potentially imprisonment without the citizen having been charged with or convicted of a crime) for either refusing to accept or consider the contract, or purportedly violating the adhesion contract.

How much of the US media referred to COVID-19 as the ""Wuhan virus"" before it received an official WHO designation on February 11th? Basically, was this ""Wuhan virus"" (term) a common occurrence in the US media in Feb and Jan this year?
",51181,"Max Rissuto from DFRLab has analysed this in an article published on March 17th which tests the media bias claims made by Republican politicians including GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy, who tweeted that ""Democrats are trying to score political points by calling Republicans racist"" and that the ""media called it 'Chinese coronavirus' for weeks"". While McCarthy uses the term 'Chinese coronavirus', Rissuto's analysis also includes the term 'Wuhan Virus'. It should be noted however that this analysis was performed on all English language publications, not just US-targeted media, and has only collected data up until March 10th.

DFRLab conducted a series of queries using a media monitoring tool to test the claim that media organizations are acting hypocritically in this way, gathering information about how geographic adjectives were used by the media to describe the disease before the official name of ""COVID-19"" was applied by the WHO. This data is summarized in the chart below.


(Source: @MaxBRizzuto/DFRLab)

From this data, we can see that the terms 'Wuhan Virus' &amp; 'Wuhan Coronavirus' both had widespread use in English language media from the end of January up until the WHO named the disease on February 11th. The usage was comparable to the usage of the terms 'China Virus', and less commonly, 'Chinese Coronavirus'. After this date, we see the usage fall away dramatically, albeit not entirely, up until the recent debacle surrounding the use of geographic adjectives by various US and international politicians. This could also be due to the fact that as the virus spread throughout China, publications that would have used 'Wuhan Virus' found 'China Virus' to be more accurate.

In conclusion then, while a significant proportion of articles used the term 'Wuhan Virus' prior to naming conventions for the disease being established, after this point most media outlets switched to using the official terminology. The usage of the term has seen a resurgence in the media recently due in part to publications reporting on some politician's continued use of this terminology.
",Accepted,"Property does not tie directly to a particular person, nor is that mapping at all uniform for all members of society.  Police still need to get a search warrant to investigate the crime for several reasons, including:


Police could uncover evidence of other crimes, perhaps committed by other individuals living or associated with the deceased in some way.  That evidence would be inadmissible against the still living offenders without a proper search warrant.
Criminals, especially in violent crimes like this one typically are associated with their victims in some way.  For example, the suspect is believed to have killed his mother in this case.  An unwarranted search in this case could unnecessarily violate the rights of several of the victims as well.
The deceased is still only a suspect.  Again, in this very case the press originally identified the wrong person as the suspect.  It could yet turn out (however unlikely that may be) that the suspect was just another victim and without following the proper procedures, the real murderer may never come to justice.


It is often times frustrating to see these types of activities eat up valuable time in the pursuit of a criminal, but given the closeness with which we interact with other people and the seriousness with which we protect and value our privacy, it is important that our justice system operate blindly, even boringly, in its even handed pursuit of the truth.

4908,51183,"Can Romanian politicians, army, police, etc be held accountable for decisions taken while in a ""state of emergency""?","Romania has declared a state of emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has a few effects. Two of which I consider relevant for this questions are:


they limit some of people's rights (like the right to move freely, for ex);
some decisions can badly affect certain categories of people (lose jobs, unable to get access to care, difficulty in access food, for ex).


Old people are the most affected and in extreme situations. They might die not because of the virus, but because of decisions that are taken to slow down the progression of the virus, like being unable to access care, or medicine, or food because people are restricted in what they can do and health services are restricted in what cases they treat.

My question is this: If Romanian politicians take bad decisions, or police and military enforce bad decisions and this causes deaths that could have been avoided if they had more... ""common sense"" let's say... after the state of emergency ends, are they accountable for their actions? Or does anything go during a state of emergency with no consequences for those in power?
",51186,"The general answer to this, which applies in most democratic countries, is that governments are not legally responsible for ""bad"" decisions, whether made during a state of emergency or not. The main reasons for this are:


Who is to say what is a ""bad"" decision? It's rarely obvious, even with 20/20 hindsight, and the general view is that the electorate is responsible for deciding, which means:
the redress for governments who make bad decisions is that at the next election the people will vote them out.


That said, a state of emergency does not mean ""anything goes"". Governments are still responsible for illegal actions. If a government ordered random shootings of innocent people in the street that would still be illegal, even in a state of emergency, and any soldier who carried out such an action could be prosecuted. A state of emergency extends what is legal, but doesn't extend it indefinitely. It might be legal to force the closure of businesses in a state of emergency, but not to kill random people.

The vote was generally along party lines, with one exception: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell voted against the cloture measure alongside the Democrats, despite arguing forcefully for the passage of the bill. I've noticed this with other bills and with Harry Reid before McConnell, so it's not just this bill – it seems like a more common pattern.

Why would the Senate Majority leader vote against cloture on a bill that they support? Is it a procedural issue?
",51187,"While looking for more examples of this process, I stumbled upon the answer.  

Why is Harry Reid always voting against his own plans?


  Forty U.S. senators voted to block a final vote on Chuck Hagel's nomination to be defense secretary. Of those, 39 were Republicans opposed to the nomination, at least for the moment. The other was Harry Reid. It wasn't that Reid opposed Hagel — far from it. ...
  
  So what gives? In articles like the one I wrote on the Hagel filibuster, the short explanation we give is that Reid voted no ""for procedural reasons"" or because a no vote ""allows him to bring another cloture vote in the future."" ...
  
  As Sarah Binder, a Senate rules expert at George Washington University, told me, it's not that the majority leader has to vote no. It's that somebody on the winning side of the cloture vote — in this case, the side voting against cloture — has to file a ""motion to reconsider"" if the matter is to be taken up again. ""I suppose the broader parliamentary principle here is that it would be somewhat unfair to give someone on the losing side of a question a second bite at the apple,"" Binder explains. So the rules provide for senators whose opinion has changed to motion for another vote, whereas those whose opinion stays the same don't get to keep filing to reconsider.
  
  Reid, and other majority leaders before him, have developed a clever workaround: Just change your vote at the last minute if it looks as though you're going to lose, then move to reconsider. In theory, any supporter of the bill or nomination in question could do the same, but traditionally it's been the majority leader.


Senate rules say that after a failed cloture vote (ie. the bill did not get the 60 votes needed to overrule a filibuster), a ""Motion to Reconsider"" (that is, a second attempt at cloture) can only be called by a member of the winning side of the vote.
",Accepted,"tl;dr> Correlation != Causation.

The difficulty in achieving any statistically relevant study is that you only have one data point - namely the expansion of all colonial empires correlated with the time period of the Mercator projection.  Thus, strictly speaking, you only have one degree of freedom in terms of data, constraining you to one exogenous variable.  That is simply insufficient to construct any type of model that has any residual explanatory power.  

Prior to the Mercator projection, you only had Ptolemy's Maps which were based on star sightings, and were accurate as far as latitude was concerned, but not longitude.  As such, there was no scientifically rigorous way of approximating land area in visual form.  For this reason, after Herschel's clock enabled longitude to be reckoned with precision for the first time, the King of France could decry the loss of 20% of his empire (which had been calculated based on approximations of longitude, rather than reality.) But, to ascribe to Ptomley the propagandistic effect of exaggerating longitude in order to enhance the Kingdom of France would be laughable, not least of the reasons of which are that Ptolemy's purpose was simply to arrange cities north to south and to make a best guess at east west relations.  

And, while Ptolemy had Erothanes' best guess as to the measure of the earth, there is not as much evidence that Mercator did, not that he particularly would have cared. Mercator's goal was to make the lives of the sea captians easier. 

The fact of the matter with regards to the Peters-Gall Projection, or any other projection for that matter, is that the creators of any map do have a point that a bias is inherent to the visualization. And indeed, Mark Monomer's How to Lie With Maps cites many persuasive pieces of propoganda that have been used throughout the years. But, to attribute a propagandistic motive to Mercator is an accusation after the fact.  As pointed out, Mercator's projection allowed for simple dead reckoning by sailors.  If it had an unintended propagandistic side effect, that is not documented nor is it statistically testable.

Thus to answer the question directly, yes, in fact, on 100% of the earth's using the Mercator Projection, it is correlated with a group of nations that were colonial empires in nature.  And, in 100% of the earth's prior to it, you also had colonial empires, such as Rome, China, the Maya and Aztec, the Indus, etc... Whether or not it is causative, however, lies beyond the realm of statistics to answer, because there is simply an insufficient number of earth's to reproduce the hypothesis.

In other words, any run-off has to take place the week after the first round of voting.

But, absent any constitutional provision to the contrary, anything and everything that is defined in a statute can in principle be undone by the parliament. Postponing the run-off at the last minute is a very ad hoc solution, not something that would be part of a well-defined procedure.

At this point, the government rescinded the décret calling the election and the parliament (both chambers) adopted a statute dealing with several issues arising from this (what to do with the results, etc.) In fact, that statute also extends the term of all town councils that haven't been replaced, as it could otherwise be deemed to expire.

It also provides that before setting a new date the government must publish the conclusions of its advisory scientific committee and that if it turns out to be impossible to organise the run-off in June then the election would be completely cancelled and the process should be restarted from scratch (new candidates, new ballots, new campaign, etc.)

Obviously, from a purely legal point of view, all these dispositions are also liable to be changed at any time should the parliament agree to do so.

what were the Republican objections to the counter-proposal?
",51236,"House Republican Whip Steve Scalise has given a press release which outlines the objections of Republicans to the bill, calling it a wishlist of ""insane far-left policies"". The objections in particular seem to relate to the amount of non-coronavirus related provisions within the bill. Republicans argue that these measures are unnecessary, and an abuse of the pressure currently on Congress to come up with a rescue package.

I won't reproduce the whole list of provisions that Scalise has picked out as objectionable, but they include environmental reform policies, an increase to the minimum wage, a law to force companies to disclose board of director diversity statistics, and a requirement that unions should have a seat on airline corporate boards. Many of these policies seem tangentially related, if at all, to the COVID-19 crisis.

These concerns have been echoed by other Republican groups, such as the Republican House Oversight Committee, who tweeted:


  Speaker Pelosi's #coronavirus bill includes: 
  
  
  Provisions for a federal takeover of elections
  A climate change study on aviation
  Intrusive corporate diversity reporting burdens

  Perhaps the most troubling sections of the bill are under the rubric
  ‘‘American Coronavirus/COVID–19 Election Safety and Security” or
  ‘‘ACCESS” Act. This section would impose requirements on states for
  early voting, voting by mail, required mailing of absentee ballots to
  everyone, ballot harvesting (i.e., having third parties deliver
  absentee ballots), online voter registration, same-day registration
  and other practices which undermine confidence in the integrity of the
  ballot. In these days of increasing threats to election security we
  should be moving rapidly back to in-person paper ballots, but this
  bill would be a radical step in the wrong direction.

5006,51252,Is it possible for a country to ask China for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?,"A part of this answer got me wondering if another state can request compensations over the huge economical cost of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics:


  (..) the region (HK, Singapore, SK?, China) was hit much harder during the 2003 SARS epidemic so spent more time getting prepared.
  
  (..) it has long been the expectation that the next epidemic would come out of China, both due to population density and proximity to livestock/wild animals, so those countries could expect another ""gift"" from their Chinese neighbors.


Theoretically it can be argued that China could have tackle ""the proximity to livestock/wild animals"" to avoid another pandemic. 

Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over a pandemic started in another country. Or a pandemic is assimilated to a naturally occurring event regardless of context?

Question: Is it possible for a country to ask for compensation over damage done by SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that most likely started in China?
",51254,"First, let's address the biological point. China is not 'responsible' for this novel coronavirus or the pandemic it is generating. Viruses are constantly mutating, and all it takes to begin an epidemic is for one person to encounter one animal that has a mutated strain of a virus, a strain which can jump species and start transmitting itself human to human. Humans are social creatures; they will have social contact and pass the strain on to others. Of course, being in a densely packed region with exposure to livestock increases the odds of that kind of encounter and maximizes the rate of transmission — lots of people nearby to infect, so the disease doesn't have to work its way outward — but that is a condition of poverty as much as anything else. People living on marginal incomes will pack together and bring their livestock with them, because they cannot afford the luxuries of personal space or shipped-in food.

And frankly, while poverty exacerbates diseases, it does not create them. The next pandemic could just as easily start because some well-to-do American on his country estate gets shat on by an infected bird. Novel infections are a natural phenomenon. We are not immune to the workings of nature (despite our pretensions) so epidemics will happen on a rare but regular basis. Blaming a particular region for a pandemic is like blaming your neighbor because you got crabgrass in your lawn. Crabgrass doesn't know, or care, whose lawn it is.

This 'neighbor' example is a good analogy for the problem this question faces. Currently, all states are treated as sovereign, like a neighborhood of houses in which each homeowner has absolute say over what he gets to do with his house and yard. There is no overarching governance: no courts, no police, no administrators, no higher authority to appeal to, to force a neighbor to do this or that on his property. The UN is like a town hall in which people come together to argue and make resolutions, but it has no real teeth except as individual sovereigns agree to abide by its decisions. This leaves only a few options on the table:


Shrug and ignore what other sovereign homeowners do on their own turf, implicitly accepting the bad things that might float over the fence into one's own yard (i.e., the status quo).
Try to create agreements that commit all parties to certain kinds of behavior (i.e. pacts and treaties): a slow and difficult process to begin with, and one that any sovereign can back out of at any convenient-for-them time.
Restrict the ability of particular sovereign homeowners to interact with the community, in the hopes that deprivation will force them into compliance (i.e., sanctions, embargoes, etc.).
Create independent, unaligned groups that ask permission to enter another's sovereign territory to solve particular problems before they spread (i.e, NGO's and such). Note that sovereign homeowners are under no obligation to allow such groups access, and can interfere with such groups' work in any way they desire.
Force your way onto another's sovereign territory to solve the problem against that sovereign's will (i.e., war).


So long as we maintain the decrepit ideal of sovereign nations, there's not much we can do to prevent the spread of a disease through a nation and across its borders. There is nothing at all we can do to prevent the birth of a novel disease. And unless we are willing to address underlying social issues like poverty and overpopulation, we are as much to blame as anyone else for pandemics of this sort, so there is no point in trying to collect 'compensation' for some imagined wrongdoing we project onto others.

5009,51265,What measures has Romania taken to contain the returning diaspora?,"News about Romania's COVID-19-driven, reverse diaspora:


  Over 200,000 Romanians who worked abroad have returned to the country since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, with many of them coming from those EU countries strongly affected by the pandemic, PM Ludovic Orban said on Friday [March 27].
  
  “On February 25 there was only one case in Romania, two cases of coronavirus in Spain, and several others in France. Look at the number of cases in Romania, less over 1,000, and if we also take into the account the cured ones, we have below 1,000 patients with COVID-19, while there are tens of thousands of infections in other countries. Romania has taken serious measures from the start”, the premier stated.
  
  Besides, he underlined that Romania had another particularity as against the other countries, namely that over 200,000 Romanians from Diaspora returned to the homeland. “If we had not taken severe containment measures, be it quarantine or isolation, the spread would have been larger”, Orban added.


How did Romania manage to quarantine 200,000 people returning from abroad (if I understand correctly that's what they did)? What specific enforcement measures did they take?
",51275,"I don't have a complete list of all the measures taken, but in large strokes, the following things happened:


schools were closed very soon after the first cases of covid-19 were discovered;
large gatherings of people were prohibited (not more than 100, then after some period not more than 50);
a state of emergency was declared when there were relatively few cases of infections compared to the population number;
a lot of local districts started to take actions on their own, like closing public parks.
the private sector also took action. Companies encouraged employees to work from home, sporting events were canceled, stores changed their program or limit the number of shoppers at any given time, hypermarkets started to disinfect their shopping carts and protect their cashiers with glass windows, trains in the subway station would pull only one by one at the platform to limit the number of passengers that would gather together.
because a state of emergency was declared, new laws were passed to control what people were doing. First there were restrictions to be on the streets between 22:00 and 06:00. This lasted for a few days, then restrictions were put in place all day. Now or example you are not allowed to exit the home unless for some specific reasons like buying food, seek medical help, take care of elderly people, go to work, and a few others. People above 65 are not allowed to go out of their home unless they have an emergency. For other activities they are only allowed to go out between 11:00 and 13:00. Stores reinforce this by allowing only the elderly to shop in that time interval. Now all parks are closed. And groups of more than 3 people are disallowed. All shops and malls that don't sell food or things you need to survive were closed.


These are a few things that happened since the whole covid-19 cases started to happen in Romania.

Now, to your question. Because we are in a state of emergency the law was changed to account for the pandemic situation. If you have returned from abroad you need to go into self-isolation or you are placed under quarantine (for 14 days if I remember correctly). You are not allowed to leave your house and friends, family or couriers must provide you with food and supplies. You don't interact with them, they just leave them at the door. If you do not respect these measures, the fines are now very large, up to 20000 RON (more than 4000 EUR), and you can also go to jail. If you breach self-isolation or quarantine and you are discovered, you are being placed under military guard so you don't do it again.

Now, with that being said, you can't really monitor 200000 people or keep them in check. There are controls, but you can't really keep them isolated. Many were discovered wondering the streets, going to parties, visiting friends, etc by the authorities. It helps I guess that there is some panic and people will report those that they know came from abroad and are not sitting put (mothers have reported their children to the authorities, for examples).

So basically that's what's happening right now. We have lower cases of infections than other countries because everyone reacted quickly and took measures before things were bad. Because movement is restricted this limits contact between persons. People also isolated themselves in the houses by precaution before the state of emergency was declared (for example, a few days before the state of emergency was declared, people hit the stores and bought all the flour and yeast, rice, canned produce, etc to stay in home for weeks) because of worry, fear, panic.

For further reference, some details on the infection in Romania:

https://instnsp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/5eced796595b4ee585bcdba03e30c127

(on the left, in red are the total confirmed cases, in yellow are persons under quarantine, blue is people in isolation at home, in gray are the number of deceased people)

My belief is that authorities panicked when they saw what was happening in Italy for example (many Romanians live there and return for Easter Holiday each year) so they took harsh measures before  it was needed. It seems it helped. Although they also took some bad decisions like limiting access to information (in the name of having it from official sources). I don't remember exactly, but I think that link above is from independently collected data, as authorities no longer report cases per district, but only globally.

EDIT: as a response to your comment I've looked up a few examples in the media:

1. In the first day of restrictions of circulation, 5,621 persons who did not comply with the measures were fined 7,404,297 RON (1,531,965 EUR). That's an average of 1,317 RON (272 EUR) per person.

2. In later news, the number of people who did not comply with the restrictions of circulation and were fined increased to 23,973, and an amount of 31,400,000 RON (6,496,730 EUR). That's an average of 1309 RON (270 EUR) per person. The same news mentions that for 209 persons a criminal record was opened and 4,235 were fined for non-compliance with the isolation/quarantine measures.

3. The news in point 2 did not mention how much the fines were for those that did not comply with isolation/quarantine, but in older news, 10 days ago, on the Ministry of Health's website it was stated that 1,835,000 RON (379,665 EUR) of fines were applied to 120 persons for not respecting the measure of isolation. That's an average of 15,291 RON (3,163 EUR) per person.

So the fines for breaking isolation/quarantine are quite large (plus getting a criminal record for more severe situations). For reference, the minimum net wage in Romania is 1,346 RON (278 EUR) while the average net wage is 3,189 RON (659 EUR). So for a large number of people, the fines are quite large. 
",Accepted,"From of the Wikipedia link and the actual treaty, there are two parts of it:


The international relationship treaty
The Concordat


International Treaty


Article 1 would be the most troubling, stating:


  Italy recognizes and reaffirms the principle established in the first Article of the Statute of the Kingdom of 4 March 1848, according to which the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Religion is the only religion of the State.


So much for Church-State1 separation; it lacks practical details (which specific rights the Church gets out of this?) and refers to the Statuto Albertino that also lacks details


  Article 1. The Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion is the sole religion of the state. All other forms of worship now existing are tolerated in conformity with the law.


Not the most enticing wording, but vague enough to allow for a claim of Church-State separation.
The rest of the Treaty simply does not address the Church-State issue. It is basically a recognition of Italy of the Vatican as an independent country2. It is a State-State treaty. Other than allowing travel and residence rights to Vatican ""citizens"" and some minor points, there are no obligations beyond international laws.


Concordat

The Concordat is the true Church-State treaty. And it includes things like:


  Art. 5 No Ecclesiastic may be employed or remain in the employment of an office of the Italian State or any public entity depending from the same without the nihil obstat of the Diocesan ordinary.


So the Church says to the State if he can hire or not priests and the like...


  Art. 20. Bishops before taking possession of their dioceses shall take an oath of fidelity to the head of the State according to the following formula


Art. 34 says that the State recognizes the civil effects of Catholic marriage, and reserves to Catholic tribunals the right to cancel marriages. So (from my reading), no possibility of divorce; because if the Church does not cancel the marriage then the participants are still married in the civil dimension, too.


  Art. 36. Italy, considering the teaching of Christian doctrine according to the form received by Catholic tradition as the foundation and the crown of public instruction, agrees that religious instruction imparted in the public elementary schools shall have a further development in the secondary schools according to a programme to be established by an accord between the Holy See and the State.


Mandatory religious instruction.


  Art. 39. The Universities, the greater and lesser Seminaries, diocesan, inter-diocesan or regional, the academies, the colleges and other Catholic Institutes for Ecclesiastical formation and culture shall continue to depend solely from the Holy See without any interference on the part of the scholastic authority of the Kingdom.


Church control of universities.

The State also reserves some powers for itself (it can protest bishop nominations, bishops must be Italians, etc.)

So, it seems to be far from being a ""separation"". 

I would like to add that it could be argued that any concordat is by definition a breach of the separation of Church and State, since it imposes obligations on each of the parties to the benefit of the other. Of course, not all of the obligations are equally damaging.

Question: How have US pro-life groups responded to Trump's stance during the COVID-19 crisis, given that this stance could permit more deaths?

A National Review article seems to indicate pro-life groups are reconciling the deaths by arguing that a poor economy will also lead to deaths, but even Republican politicians are arguing that large numbers of dead people will hurt the economy:


  There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages, including our doctors and nurses, lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus.
  Rep. Liz Cheney, via Twitter


So it's unclear to me how US pro-life groups can reconcile this.
",51271,"There's nothing to reconcile. Pro-life doesn't mean 'against (needless) death', it means anti-abortion. [The same is true for the opposite label: Pro-choice means in favor of legal access to abortion, not necessarily in favor of all individual choices (eg regarding assisted suicide or drug policies).]  

People supporting ""Pro-life"" can still support the death penalty, wars, restricted access to healthcare (for the poor), terrorist attacks against abortion providers, denial of healthcare to pregnant women even in case of a non-viable fetus, etc.

Response to the lax attitude regarding human life has been minimal, as that is not their issue; abortions are. The focus during this crisis by anti-abortion groups seems to be to further attack legal access to abortion. The SBA List coronavirus page or the Live Action news page eg focus on denying access to abortion &amp; defunding abortion providers during the crisis.

The few responses I was able to find are not from groups, but individuals, and seem to argue in the same direction as you mention: Relativizing the deaths by downplaying the risk &amp; impact and saying that a weak economy will also have a price. Eg:  


  economic hardship without a clear path to recovery imperils lives too (as evidence by a 300% spike in calls to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline); [...] targeted isolation of and care for the elderly is entirely possible while allowing the younger and healthier to go about their lives.


Others take a more utilitarian approach, weighing the ""lives saved"" due to denied access to abortion during the crisis vs deaths from coronavirus.

At least some individual people who hold anti-abortion views have opposed the economy > life view. The following quote is attributed to Rep. Cheney, though I was only able to find it by Erick Erickson:


  Letting the virus spread to your parents and grandparents to protect your 401k is not pro-life.

I have recently saw a Romanian economist speaking about this issue and I was wondering how US and EU are dealing with this.

The European Central Bank decided to buy €750 billion worth of bonds while the US is considering printing more dollars (my emphasis).

The Fed, the one entity in the world with the power to create dollars out of thin air, has every intention of doing so at whatever magnitude is necessary to try to reduce the severity and limit the duration of the coronavirus economic crisis.

  Under one measure, anyone who disseminates information that could hinder the government’s response to the epidemic could face up to five years in prison. The legislation gives broad latitude to the public prosecutor to determine what counts as distorted or false information.

The Independent Hungarian newspaper Index has more detail.

The government can expand emergency declarations indefinitely without Parliamentary approval:


  The new law allows the government to make these extensions themselves indefinitely, or at least until Parliament decides to revoke this authorisation before the state of emergency is over


It gives the government vague and expansive powers to arrest people for ""false or distorting"" speech:


  The new law also introduces a vaguely worded new paragraph to the already existing offence of scaremongering in the Criminal Code, which opponents of the law say could threaten critical press:
  
  
    ""Anyone who, under a special legal order, in public, utters or spreads statements known to be false or statements distorting true facts shall be punishable by imprisonment between 1 to 5 years if done in a manner capable of hindering or derailing the effectiveness of the response effort.""
  


And it give them the power to suspend laws and cancel elections:


  The Coronavirus Act also introduces a number of other changes to the constitutional order of the country:
  
  
  The government will be allowed to take steps beyond the extraordinary measures listed in the Disaster Relief Act and suspend the application of certain laws by decree if necessary and proportional to protect citizens' health, life, property, rights, and to secure the stability of the economy in connection with the pandemic. ...
  No local or national elections or referendums can be held until the end of the state of emergency, elections and referendums already scheduled will take place after the special legal order ends. Municipal councils dissolved during the state of emergency stay in place until the end of the special legal order.

The law is in sync with the indefinite and uncontrolled state of the virus and its progressing spread. The law grants no extraordinary powers outside the scope of the epidemic.

Regarding human rights and democracy
The law does extend the criminal code (BTK) 337. § (2) with regulations on spreading false statements, just like with The First Amendment the limitations on free speech are almost always specific to particular cases.

The law has been objected that elections are stalled until the end of the epidemic. Since no digital election system has been introduced as of yet it is a correct move to open the possibility to skip these public gatherings. The coming major elections are due in 2022, this law will very likely not impact that in any way.

The most important thing to point out is that this law just like the virus is temporary, and can be put to an end even before the end of the epidemic 3. § (2) by the government, so there is little the Secretary General could reasonably object.

5070,52324,Can the U.S. president increase toilet paper supplies?,"I saw a recent news article about President Trump, forcing car makers to make ventilators. 

In the US there also a significant shortage of toilet paper, which seem to be a supply and demand problem.  People want more than the available supply. 

Can the president increase toilet paper supplies?  
",52325,"President Trump was able to do that with ventilators because of the Defense Production Act:


  On March 18, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, President Trump issued an executive order that defined ventilators and protective equipment as ""essential to the national defense"", the standard required by the DPA.[17][18] Later that day, he indicated that he would not make immediate use of DPA authority, writing, ""Hopefully there will be no need""; he indicated that he would do so in a ""worst-case scenario"".[19][20] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called upon Trump to ""immediately use the powers of the DPA to mass produce and coordinate distribution of"" critically needed hospital equipment such as ventilators, swabs, and personal protective equipment.[19][20] On March 20, Trump said that he will use the DPA.[21] General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra spoke to Trump administration officials about how GM could support production of ventilators.[22] On March 23, Trump issued an executive order classifying ""health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19"" as subject to the authority granted by DPA to prohibit hoarding and price gouging.[23][24] Trump's continued reluctance to use the act's authorities prompted further criticism.[25] On March 27, 2020, after negotiations with GM to produce ventilators had broken down over cost, which was being estimated at over $1 billion, but primarily due to GM’s uncertainty as to its ability to provide the number of ventilators required speedily, Trump ordered HHS Secretary Alex Azar to use the authority available under the DPA to require GM to accept and prioritize contracts for the number of ventilators that Azar determines to be appropriate.[26] Trump also named Peter Navarro national policy coordinator for the DPA.[27]


For Trump to do this for toilet paper, he would need to declare it vital to national defense. That seems kind of silly to me, but I recon he could do that. It has been done for ""aerospace structures"":


  In June 13, 2017, President Donald Trump invoked the law to classify as ""critical to national defense"" two sets of products. The first referenced ""items affecting aerospace structures and fibers, radiation-hardened microelectronics, radiation test and qualification facilities, and satellite components and assemblies"".[13][14]

As the AP reports (thanks to @Fizz for pointing this out), Defense Secretary Mark Esper has announced that the troops being withdrawn from Syria won't be coming home to the US: instead, they're going to Iraq to continue fighting ISIS:


  [Defense Secretary Mark] Esper’s earlier comments to reporters traveling with him were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they shift from Syria and what the counter-IS fight could look like. Esper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift about 1,000 troops from Syria into western Iraq.
  
  Esper said the troops going into Iraq will have two missions: help defend Iraq and perform a counter-IS mission.

At the same time Trump announced that he was withdrawing 50 troops from Syria, he announced the deployment of 3000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia for potential use against Iran:


  WASHINGTON — The United States is sending about 3,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia in the latest military response by the Trump administration after it accused Iran of attacks last month on Saudi oil facilities, the Pentagon said on Friday.
  
  The move came only five days after President Trump said that his desire to terminate America’s “endless wars” led to his decision to pull back from the border area between Syria and Turkey about 50 troops who were working to create a “safe zone” between Turkish and Kurdish troops.
  
  Trump Orders Troops and Weapons to Saudi Arabia in Message of Deterrence to Iran – The New York Times 


As of the end of October, it seems people's skepticism was well founded: as The New York Times reports, Trump has reversed course and is increasing the number of US troops in Syria, back up to a number near the original level:


  WASHINGTON — Every day in northeastern Syria, waves of American troops are pulling out under President Trump’s order this month that paved the way for a Turkish offensive that included assaults on the Pentagon’s allies, the Syrian Kurds.
  
  And at the same time, a separate wave of American troops from the opposite direction is pouring back in.
  
  In fact, once the comings and goings are done, the total number of United States forces in Syria is expected to be about 900 — close to the 1,000 troops on the ground when Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of American forces from the country.
  
  ...
  
  By Oct. 20, things were shifting again. Mr. Trump was talking about the need to protect the oil fields in eastern Syria. Pentagon officials began working on a plan to send additional American troops to guard oil fields.
  
  When combined with the troops at Al-Tanf, that brings the number of American troops projected to be in Syria to near 900, a number that could easily rise if, as expected, the Islamic State begins to make a comeback.
  
  Hundreds of U.S. Troops Leaving, and Also Arriving in, Syria - The New York Times, 10/31/2019


So, in the end this so-called ""withdrawal"" appears to be little more than a troop relocation.



And finally, even if US troops had been withdrawn from Syria, the initial plan was only to withdraw 50. The US expanded the withdrawal plan only after pressure from Turkey and Turkish-backed militias:


  Less than 48 hours before the withdrawal announcement, U.S. Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had given assurances that the troops would remain indefinitely, standing by their Kurdish partners to continue to hunt down the Islamic State.
  
  But the Turks’ capture Sunday of a key highway that served as the U.S. troops’ main supply line revealed the fragility of [their] mission
  
  The hasty U.S. pullback from Syria is a searing moment in America’s withdrawal from the Middle East  - The Washington Post 


In summary:


The troops aren't being withdrawn – they're just being moved to another war zone to continue the same mission
Instead of decreasing, the number of US troops in the Middle East has actually increased, and they've done so in a way that represents an escalation in tensions with Iran, thus making war more likely.
The so-called ""Withdrawal"" appears to have been little more than a troop relocation. As of November, the total number of US troops in Syria is little changed from the number that were there before the ""withdrawal""
Even if US troops had actually been withdrawn from Syria, many would question how much credit Trump should get, since that plan seemed to have been driven more by circumstances than any actual plan or desire to bring US troops home.

5146,52338,Is there an explanation for why ~20% of Americans think the US's response to COVID-19 has been better than South Korea's?,"In this article, it's claimed that 20% of the US thinks the US is handling the COVID-19 outbreak better than South Korea, 21% think it's about the same, 26% think it's worse, and 32% aren't sure. This is something I find surprising, since for the metrics I've been looking at, South Korea is doing better in every way:



It seems obvious that the 41% of people who think the US is doing as well as or better than South Korea are looking at different metrics than me, and I'd like to know what these other metrics are.

NB: I'm focusing on South Korea because although the original article also says the majority of Americans polled thinks the US outperforms China/Italy, there is a metric that I'm already aware of (total deaths, and in the case of Italy, total cases/deaths per capita) for which the US is doing better than those countries at the time of the poll, so if total deaths is what matters for most Americans then it's defensible to say the US is doing better. I'm not aware of any such metric for South Korea, however, which is why I'm asking.

Alternatively, what else can explain the US poll data?
",52341,"The key assumption you have made is assuming people in the US act sensibly, and that they would base their answer in the poll on facts. This assumption might not be accurate. A recent (Jan 2019) study shows that facts might not be too important in this matter [1].


  Inaccurate views of scientific consensus and the willful rejection of scientific consensus.
  In a 2014 US survey (15), two-thirds of respondents (67%) thought that scientists did “not have a clear understanding about the health effects of GM crops,” despite broad scientific consensus on the topic (16). Similarly, half of Americans (52%) thought scientists were “divided” in the belief that the universe was created in the Big Bang, and about a third each thought that scientists were divided on anthropogenic climate change (37%) and evolution (29%). Of course, these data do not make clear the cause of these inaccurate views, which, arguably, could stem from people being uninformed, intentionally misinformed, or a bit of both.
  
  Furthermore, split-ballot survey experiments have shown that even when Americans do seem to possess accurate knowledge of scientific consensus (however large or small that number may be for a given issue) there is no guarantee that they will integrate that knowledge into their attitudes or policy preferences (17). In other words, these respondents know what the scientific community has established as fact, but they nonetheless refuse to “know” it. Some have therefore argued that rejection of scientifically accurate accounts of the Big Bang or evolution by nonexpert audiences indicates neither a lack of information about scientific consensus nor the presence of misinformation, but, rather, motivated information processing (18). (Highlight mine).


Given that the current US government places little value on facts and that ""Make America Great Again"" was a slogan in the last election, I find it highly plausible that this is a factor here, too - that a certain amount of people simply want to believe that the US is the best in the world in everything, despite facts showing otherwise.

The study also finds:


  When such directional goals influence reasoning processes, individuals are prone to “biased assimilation,” which is characterized by confirmation and disconfirmation bias, or the parallel tendencies to privilege information that is consistent with one’s predispositions and to discredit information that seems contradictory (51). As with selective exposure, motivated reasoning can contribute to an individual becoming misinformed, and it can occur not only in political contexts but also when individuals process information about science and emerging technologies (52–54).


If you want to believe the US is #1 in everything, this seems to be a highly relevant point.

Also, emotional state can be an important factor. And I think we can agree that the current crisis is a very emotional matter, and that believing the US is doing better than anyone else might be reassuring, even if it isn't based on truth.


  The role of emotion.
  This brings us to discussions of the influence of affect in motivated reasoning processes. There is some evidence that a person’s emotional state can shape the accuracy of his or her beliefs. [...] Notably, individuals’ attraction to emotionally charged content is not limited to politics, and even when it comes to scientific discoveries, individuals are more inclined to spread information that has a greater emotional impact (59).


1: Scheufele, Dietram A, and Nicole M Krause. “Science audiences, misinformation, and fake news.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America vol. 116,16 (2019): 7662-7669. doi:10.1073/pnas.1805871115



So I think the answer is not that there are any objective metrics that show that the US is handling the crisis better in any way. The fatality rate is magnitudes higher (although it is too early to tell what the toll will be in the end), cases per capita are higher, total cases are higher, et cetera. I don't think there are those metrics that you are looking for. I rather think think it simply shows that a large percentage of the US population is either uninformed or misinformed, for various reasons as outlined above.



From the survey that was linked in the question, we can also see that the opinion on how the US is handling it relative to the rest of the world varies dramatically with the political orientation of the respondent, which would further back up that political orientation plays a significant role in how people perceive facts and responded.



The poll data for the question relative to South Korea is roughly in the same boat, polarization-wise. Only about 6% of Republicans say the US is doing worse than South Korea, whereas 45% of Democrats say that:


",Accepted,"After reading the attempts to quantify the veracity of the comparisons there is an easy answer that does not require putting people down or rationalizing cognitive dissonance.

The actual answer is what does the question mean from the perspective of those answering the question. What people actually think when answering this question: Has the handling of the crisis good for me? and secondarily: If I lived in South Korea would it be good for me?

Of course, if you look at it from the point of view of how the statistics work out, it is very unlikely you are personally directly affected by this particular crisis.  I'm not counting staying at home and losing your job, which is an indirect effect and most likely favored as a way of handling the crisis.

A number of times, he tells us that he is being advised by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.

Here is a webpage describing the AHPPC: https://www.health.gov.au/committees-and-groups/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc


  The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee is the key decision making committee for health emergencies. It is comprised of all state and territory Chief Health Officers and is chaired by the Australian Chief Medical Officer.


The Chief Medical Officer is Brendan Murphy.

For the other members of the committee, we are left with this:

  Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population or an identifiable part of a population.


For example, the Charter of the Nuremberg tribunal includes this definition:


  Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.


Condoning violence is not enough, you have to actually carry out one of these acts and systematically target an entire population or a specific group (like Jews for the Nazis). Basically, the idea is to avoid letting people get away with something that does not quite rise to the level of a genocide.

Quite apart from all that, this is unlikely to have any practical relevance, unless some future government of the Philippines finds it expedient to deliver him to the ICC.

5149,52371,What are the benefits of the proposed Euro/Corona bonds over conventional government bonds?,"This article describes the efforts of several European Union countries to agree to issue ""corona bonds"" or ""Eurobonds"", which are a joint EU mechanism to issue joint debt shared between different countries. This measure is being proposed in order to ""mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus"". It says:


  “We need to recognize the severity of the situation and the necessity
  for further action to buttress our economies today,” the heads of
  state of Italy, France, Belgium, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland,
  Slovenia and Luxembourg said Wednesday in a joint letter seen by CNBC.
  
  [...]
  
  “We need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European
  institution to raise funds on the market on the same basis and to the
  benefits of all Member States,” the nine heads of state said.


Given that there doesn't seem to be any restriction on European Union countries issuing their own government bonds, what are the benefits of these new proposed instruments over this conventional measure?
",52377,"Expanding on the answer by Tin Nguyen, the Euro is a a common currency for nations with separate economic policies and separate national debts. Being a member of the Eurozone stops nations from devaluating their currency to compensate for changing economic fundamentals.

Before and during the 2007 financial crisis bonds from e.g. Greece or Italy had a risk premium compared to German bonds despite the fact that both were government bonds in the same currency. There were even signs that futures traders were driving this premium up by betting against certain governments, or on nations leaving the Eurozone. The famous ""whatever it takes"" speech by Draghi calmed that.

The financial consequences of the Corona pandemic are not yet known, but it is clear that Italy and Spain will be hit hard. That will increase the risk on a default on national debt which increases the interest which investors demand. Of course that further hinders economic recovery.

If the Eurozone members jointly guarantee bonds, that lowers the interest payments for the less stable economies and possibly increases the interest for the more stable ones. This might or might not be to the benefit of the EU as a whole and the stronger members individually (since they all benefit from a strong Eurozone), but the more or less clearly voiced suspicion is that Corona is used as an excuse to enact a permanent transfer mechanism.
",Accepted,"In this scenario, theoretically, the Vice-President of the previous administration should become President for the few minutes until 12 noon when the incoming President's term starts.



This is because:


Though the Vice-President of the new administration had already taken his oath of office, his term has not started constitutionally.


The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution states:

  Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.

The Constitution isn't clear if the Oath of Office is necessary for the President to take office. The text simply states:



  Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

So, even though the incoming VP has already taken the oath for Vice-Presidency, his term hasn't started yet. And even though the outgoing VP hasn't taken the oath for the Presidency, he would become President for a few minutes until it reached 12 noon when the incoming President's term starts.

5150,52389,Does the signing statement made by President Trump nullify the oversight provisions of the CARES Act?,"On March 27th, President Trump signed the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the CARES Act, into law. This came after days of debate, where Democratic lawmakers insisted on the inclusion of oversight measures before they would agree to pass the bill. A few hours after signing the act into law, the White House released a signing statement, where the President takes issue with several provisions in the bill, and states his administration's intent to treat some of these provisions as advisory or hortatory. 

Of particular interest is the following paragraph:


  Section 4018 of Division A of the Act establishes a new Special
  Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) within the Department
  of the Treasury to manage audits and investigations of loans and
  investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury under the Act. 
  Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the Act authorizes the SIGPR to request
  information from other government agencies and requires the SIGPR to
  report to the Congress “without delay” any refusal of such a request
  that “in the judgment of the Special Inspector General” is
  unreasonable.  I do not understand, and my Administration will not
  treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the
  Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take
  Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This implies that the new position of Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR) will be unable to perform their duties, as the President apparently reserves the right to supervise, and potentially suppress, any reports that the Special Inspector will attempt to make to Congress.

Is the President able to effectively nullify these provisions of the bill unilaterally, or does this signing statement have no legal weight until tested in the courts? Are any oversight mechanisms aside from this Special Investigator available to Congress?
",52397,"Signing statements do not have the force of law. Most often signing statements are used to signify how the President will interpret and enforce the law


  For example, in President Obama's signing statement for the [National Defense Authorization Act], he explained a few reasons why he chose to sign the bill (it authorizes funding for important national defense programs, etc.), then went on to point out a few sections of the bill that he viewed as unconstitutional. He then stated, ""My Administration will interpret them [some of the disputed sections] to avoid the constitutional conflict.""


In other words, signing statements are often just a different way to enact an Executive Order.

Going back to this bill, the relevant portion would be


  I do not understand, and my Administration will not treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue reports to the Congress without the presidential supervision required by the Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3.


This doesn't nullify the law, it simply says the SIGPR should not report to Congress without reporting to the President first. This does provide Trump with a preview of any report and a potential to influence the SIGPR, but there's no easy way to stop this since the SIGPR is part of the Executive Branch. Nowhere is Trump stating that the SIGPR is not to report to Congress at all (which would be a direct violation of the law).

The FBI itself notes that this does not equate to a one-to-one correlation to the number of gun sales that have taken place, but it is at least a rough indicator that the number of gun sales has also seen a large increase.

This trend held true in practically every state of the US, with the exception of Kentucky.

What are the political factors which have led to such a large increase? Clearly, as the main news story currently is the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems likely that this has had an effect, but it's unclear to me why this would lead to such a higher rate of gun background checks/purchases, especially as lockdowns start to reduce footfall at non-private sales locations.

It's become a joke how much people are hoarding toilet paper (in the US, in particular, it wasn't hard to find before this). But hoarding things is part of a broader issue (emphasis mine)


  Australia has also suffered from panic buying of toilet paper despite plentiful domestic supply. A risk expert in the country explained it this way: ""Stocking up on toilet paper is … a relatively cheap action, and people like to think that they are 'doing something' when they feel at risk.""
  
  This is an example of ""zero risk bias,"" in which people prefer to try to eliminate one type of possibly superficial risk entirely rather than do something that would reduce their total risk by a greater amount.
  
  Hoarding also makes people feel secure. This is especially relevant when the world is faced with a novel disease over which all of us have little or no control. However, we can control things like having enough toilet paper in case we are quarantined.


Guns still mean security to a lot of people

Guns are still a powerful way to protect oneself, and more than a few people fear social breakdown, despite the fact that no place in the US has suspended their police force due to the pandemic, nor are there widespread shortages of police. As such, people want weapons to stop intruders


  Hyatt said that the type of guns being bought was reflective of the fear prevalent among customers. There was almost no interest in hunting rifles. Instead, people were opting for target guns and there was big demand for AR-15 semi-automatic assault-style rifles.
  
  Asked why he thought the spike was happening, Hyatt replied: ""Financial meltdown, pandemic, crime, politics … you throw it all into the pot, and you have one hell of a mess.""

If we take Penn at is word, that would mean that his approval is 45%, disapproval is ~ 22% and no opinion is 33%. While 45% doesn't sound that high, I'd argue that it's surprising for that many people nationwide to have a positive opinion of a local politician from another state.

As a general rule, libertarianism is opposed to changes imposed by majority rule over the objections of a minority.  The more likely solution in this case would be for the nine homeowners to buy out the tenth.  

Note that it is also possible that the ten homeowners could have previously entered into a contractual relationship where the tenth homeowner would be obligated to comply with majority rule.  But that's based on freedom of contract, not majority rule as a principle.  

The best time to establish such a system is before selling the home to the person who has different values.  In a libertarian system, it is far more likely that people who favor restrictive rules would try to get that institutionalized prior to forming the community.

",Accepted,"The obvious answer is the General George Washington needed a flag to differentiate his forces from the English forces. It is speculated by historians that the flag was simply created by sewing white stripes on an English Ensign.  The design was simply expedient and similarity to the East India Company is circumstantial.

What is difficult to understand this many years removed from the events is the state of the world at the time.  The idea of a federal central government had not been realized at the time or was so new that it was not at the top of everyone's mind include the General. What I mean is every colony has its own flag which was more important to the average man. With so many symbols, picking something to represent the union was almost an after thought.

The evidence of course is not compelling, but we can speculate by the fact that the so called ""Grand Union Flag"" (So called because it was named that many decades later, it may have been called ""The Continental Color"" by contemporaries) was used to represent both land and sea forces. A practice that was not traditional at the time (There was a country flag, an ensign for ships, a battle flag, a regimental flag, etc.).  Actually there is an analog in modern times. While the flag of the country is the same as that flown on military bases, on ships and used on some military uniforms, there is a flag of sorts on military air forces. For example, the US has a circled star flanked by three strips on each side.  Any way, the continental congress used the flag and then quickly (for the day) discarded it and designed a more permanent design (so that is from around the end of 1775 to June 14 1777).

In particular, UK told that staying home this weekend is 'not a request'. To me, it sounds like loosening restriction, in an unofficial way. I don't follow British politics that much so forgive me if I'm missing the obvious. What's the deal here?
",52441,"I'm not venturing a speculation here (yet) whether that was a loosening (of the language) or not relative to prior communications on this matter, but the fuller context of that recent statement is:


  Mr Hancock - who recently ended his seven days of self-isolation after contracting the virus - said: ""We cannot relax our discipline now. If we do, people will die.
  
  ""I end with the advice we all know. This advice is not a request - it is an instruction.
  
  ""Stay at home, protect lives and then you will be doing your part.""

  ""But please, I ask to remember Aimee and Areema. Please stay at home for them.""


Aimee and Areema are two (young) nurses who recently died after contracting the new coronavirus.

The Evening Standard has chosen to headline that announcement as 


  Matt Hancock orders Brits not to break coronavirus lockdown during weekend heatwave: If we relax our discipline people will die


The Telegraph headlined their youtube video of that press conference with 


  ‘Good weather no excuse to break coronavirus social distancing rules’, says Matt Hancock


So a reasonable-enough interpretation seems to be that it's not a relaxation of the prior government stance. I don't know if some left-wing press has tried to spin this into something else.

",Accepted,"Who gets to ask?

In the Stack Exchange (SE) system, the person asking determines the accepted answer.  That's not a big problem if one person is the clear beneficiary.  But what about systems where multiple people benefit?  Who asks would determine who gets to accept an answer.  

Subject to corruption

There are regular concerns about people banding together with friends to influence the system in Stack Exchange.  This hardly ever happens.  Why not?  Mostly because the results of being the highest voted or accepted answer don't matter much.  If your answer is accepted over mine, it may bruise my ego, but it doesn't actually matter.  I don't make less money or have to do more work as a result.  

In your system, the outcome would matter.  As a result, all those worries about people banding together to control the outcome become justified.  Tactical voting would become rampant.  Closing questions so that you can ask your own question and control the acceptance criteria would be useful.  

Who's the dictator?

Many aspects of Stack Exchange are controlled democratically.  But in the end, the Stack Exchange system is a dictatorship, not a democracy.  Stack Exchange can reverse votes (e.g. if you go around down-voting a single person for disagreeing with you) and delete questions and answers (e.g. spam).  

This works for Stack Exchange for two reasons.  First, they are a relatively benevolent, hands-off dictator.  We rarely feel the tyranny because they are careful about using it.  Second, because Stack Exchange is optional.  If I decide that they are abusing their power, I can start a new site called Queue Swap tomorrow that does the same thing.  If most people agree with me about the abuse of power, I'm likely to get lots of people joining me.  That possibility keeps them honest.  

Your system would not be optional.  So we'd have to have some way of controlling the ""dictator"" in the system.  But in the end, that just gets us back to something mostly like the current system.  An empowered executive who can make the real decisions.  A frustrated minority grumbling under those decisions with which they disagree.  

Who determines urgency?


  every important decision is taken based firstly on its ranked urgency


Who determines whether a decision is important or urgent?  This isn't unsolvable, but the Stack Exchange system does not generally solve it.  Meta decisions tend to be non-binding, although some people will choose to follow them.  The real decisions about the importance and urgency of changes on Stack Exchange tend to be made by the benevolent dictator.  

What happens if the dictator disagrees with you?  For example, Obama finds Zika to be important and finds terrorism to be less important.  

Free markets as Stack Exchange

Note that a free market economy gives many of the same results as you are trying to get from your Stack Exchange system.  Most decisions are made by individuals.  Multiple answers (products) can receive up-votes (purchases).  Your individual decision controls your personal environment, much the way that acceptance controls your question in Stack Exchange.  High reputation (wealthy) users have additional moderation powers.  Yet you don't seem satisfied with this system and want to change it.  

Effecting change

As you may gather, I don't favor this change.  That said, the question of how to make change is certainly answerable.  You need to find supporters and take control of the mechanism for making changes in your country.  

To use the United States as an example, this would require either two-thirds of Congress or sufficient support in state legislatures to call a constitutional convention.  If a convention, you'd have to make sure that they voted for your amendment.  Then you need to ratify the amendment with the approval votes of the legislatures in three-quarters of the states (thirty-eight or more).  Note that the last time we had a constitutional convention, we ended up with a new constitution instead of simply amending the old one.  

This is the age old method for making changes.  It's not fast.  In the US, Republicans as a party were in favor of women's suffrage in 1860 but did not actually pass it until 1920.

5196,52460,Is there data comparing between US regions the degree of social distancing as a function of the outbreak severity?,"In Europe, such comparisons have been published based on data by Google, so I suspect it might available for the US too. E.g.


  An analysis here of smartphone location data by the U.S. search engine giant showed that visits to shops, parks or railway stations fell steeply in most European countries between Feb. 16 and March 29 as governments sought to slow the explosive spread of the COVID-19 disease.
  
  In Italy and Spain, which have imposed near-total lockdowns on public life, retail and recreational trips were down by 94%. The two Mediterranean countries, along with France, saw the sharpest drops in people passing through transportation hubs like railway or metro stations. Visits to workplaces were down by more than 60% in Italy and Spain, in an indication that their lockdowns may turn out to be the most economically disruptive.
  
  To the north, Sweden has by contrast sought to minimise disruption to social and economic life while its caseload remains low. Visits to restaurants, shopping centres and cinemas, for example, have declined by just 24%. Numbers going to grocery markets and pharmacies have fallen by 10%, while trips to the park are actually up by 43% as people head out to enjoy the Scandinavian spring. Going out for a walk or a jog is up in Denmark, Estonia and Finland too.
  
  The number of people spending more time in residential areas is up by 5% in Sweden, whereas in Italy and Spain it has increased by 24% and 22% respectively as people are confined to their homes.
  
  In Britain, which moved relatively late to restrict people-to-people contacts, the impact has been less severe than in southern Europe. Retail and recreation visits are down by 85%, public transport by 75% and time spent in workplaces by 55%.
  
  Germany, which has the third-highest caseload but a relatively low number of fatalities thanks to widespread early testing for COVID-19, has taken a less radical approach with the number of people visiting workplaces down by 39%, the data show.


Are there such (comparative) statistics available for US states? E.g. did these numbers fall in NY (which was hardest hit by the pandemic) more than elsewhere in the US?
",52462,"Yes, Google has published these statistics at a per-state level for the United States. 

To use the example in your question of New York, compared with a state with far fewer COVID-19 cases currently, such as West Virginia, we can see that New York has seen large reductions in mobility trends across every category except Residential, while West Virginia has relatively smaller reductions, and in fact a large increase in mobility trends for parks. 

This seems to be similar across the board, with the statistics for Nebraska, with a similar number of cases as West Virginia also showing smaller reductions in most categories, a smaller increase in Residential mobility trends, and a whopping 109% increase in mobility trends to parks. New Jersey, however, another state which has been fairly badly hit, sees a large reduction in the statistics across the board.

At a first glance, then, this would seem to support your theory that these numbers fell more significantly within states that have been hardest hit by the pandemic so far, meaning that social distancing measures are being complied with and taken more seriously in these states. Further analysis would need to be performed on the full data set, including the range of social distancing regulations and enforcement levels in the individual states in order to draw full conclusions.

Google themselves state in their reports that ""Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this data to compare changes between countries, or between regions with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).""
",Accepted,"I assume you mean right-wing libertarianism as it can be seen in the US.

In that case: Proponents of unrestrained capitalism don't have ""protecting things"" as part of their ideology. 

The point is that ""the market"" will take care of it. Landmarks would be privatized and whoever owns them would do with it as they please. If they want to preserve it for the sake of it, then they'd do that. If they want to preserve it and charge tourists for access, then they'd do that. 

And if they want to demolish it and built something more profitable, that would be fine too. If others want to prevent it, they'd have to try to raise funds to buy it (if the owner is willing to sell). If they can't do that, then the market has spoken. The landmark doesn't add enough value to society for people to be willing to finance it, so it should be demolished. 

In right-wing libertarian ideology, things (or people) don't have value in and of themselves, but only insofar as ""the market"" decides that they do.

5197,52461,How overcrowded are NY parks? Have they been deemed dangerously so from a public health perspective during this Covid-19 outbreak?,"According to a NY Post article, parks in New York have become so overcrowded during this Covid-19 outbreak (supposedly because residents can't find anywhere else to go, e.g. restaurants are closed), so much so that some use cemeteries as parks in the hope of finding a less crowded spot. How accurate are these journalistic impressions? Is there data on the increase in overcrowding in NY parks during this outbreak, and if so, have there been any public health estimates on the danger that these park crowds may cause?

(I see that Cuomo was incensed by the crowded parks, but that was more than a week ago. He did close playgrounds, in the meantime.)

To those who think this can't be but BS (per comments below), governor Cuomo and mayor de Blasio have disagreed often enough, e.g. The Atlantic relates their disagreement on school closures:


  De Blasio angered New York parents and some of his own allies by resisting for days a decision to close schools, acting only following pressure from Cuomo and after a near-revolt by advisers and top public-health officials. “He’s both a bad decision maker and not good at communicating about it,” said an elected New York Democrat and former ally of the mayor’s, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve a working relationship with the de Blasio administration.


So I wouldn't be surprised they disagreed about parks too. The question whether the parks are crowded obviously has a public-health and thus a political dimension too nowadays (so I disagree with those who think this is off topic.)

And if you need anther source, the March 23 story was covered by Bloomberg too, with a March 20 image:




  Tired of being cooped up at home, hordes of New Yorkers headed to Central Park and other open spaces in the city over the weekend -- and that’s making Governor Andrew Cuomo very irritated.
  
  “It’s insensitive, it’s arrogant, it’s self-destructive, it’s disrespectful to other people, and it has to stop, and it has to stop now,” he said. “This is not a joke, and I am not kidding.”
  
  Calling the crowds “wholly inappropriate” amid a statewide stay-home order, he’s now asking the city to develop a plan that he can approve Monday to correct that.
  
  “We talk about social distancing,” he said. “I was in these parks, and you would not know that anything was going on.”


I don't know how [un]reliable ""The Gothamist"" is, but they posted these images supposedly from March 27:




Of course, a lot can change in a couple of weeks in people's attitudes, even if the parks are still open. And likewise some photos may be unrepresentative. The question is: did any behavioral change happen that made the closures unnecessary, or was Cuomo ranting like a madman and there was no problem to begin with? 
",52466,"I don't know about NYC, I live in NC. Since our state and county governments began issuing stay at home orders, I've noticed an incredible number of people gathered in our parks - far more than what I'd see on a typical day.

The entrances to our state parks were closed, but access to lakes is still available for boats. It hasn't been uncommon to drive by a lake access point and see hundreds of people tightly gathered by the loading ramps. Trail-heads which on a great day would have 1 or 2 cars parked now have as many as 20 or 30. And I've never seen church parking lots so packed.

So, if NYC is anything like where I live, it wouldn't be at all surprising to find community parks jammed.

From what we hear on a daily basis, we need to stay home except for essential requirements. We need to stay at least 6 feet from anyone not in our immediate family (as in those living under the same roof). And even more recently, we need to be wearing masks when out in public. We shouldn't be hanging out with groups of more than 10 people (and that's not so much for viral safety, that's for social sanity). And like any virus, it makes no difference if it's passed indoors or out. The chance of infection remains the same either way.

While the plateau holds strategic importance for each of these three countries, it is not worth for any of them to get involved in a big military confrontation.

Farakka Barrage: India had built Farakka barrage on the river Ganga which is an international river and flows into Bangladesh with the name Padma. India first proposed the construction of Farakka Barrage in 1951 which never took the shape because of Pakistan's protest. Then again India started to construct Farakka barrage in 1961 and again the construction slipped into desuetude because of Pakistan's threat. Finally, Farakka was opened in 1975 on a trial basis (after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971). But, since then it was never taken down.
River water sharing: India has built dams/barrages on each international river upstream of Bangladesh. Tista river water sharing agreement is kept dangling for years now.
Border killing: Indian BSF has been killing Bangladeshi cattle-dealer citizens on a regular basis. Several years ago BSF killed an 15-year old girl named Falani Khatun and kept her body hanging on the barbed border-fence which received widespread international media attention.
Illegal immigrant propaganda: India says that Bangladeshi citizens cross the border and living in the Indian province of Assam illegally. Given the socio-economic scenario, this is an absurd propaganda. Muslims are living in Assam from the period of Mir Jumla II. During British Raj, Lord Curzon tried to create a new province named East Bengal by making Dhaka the capital as Dhaka was the center of Muslim culture and trade  which has failed to take shape because of widespread protest from Kolkata-centric Hindu elites. Assam was part of that proposed province. After the partition of India, native Assamese (Hindu and indigenous population) started to try to drive Muslims out of Assam. Very recently, when the BJP came to power, this drive is intensified.
Job seekers: It is believed that there are nearly a million Indians are employed in Bangladesh's service and manufacturing sectors who are straining a nearly saturated job market. 
Muslim lynching and Cattle vigilantism: In recent years, Muslim lynching because of eating/trading beef, and cattle vigilantism in India attracted widespread media coverage in Bangladesh.
Backing of Myanmar government: for the last few months, this has been a very prominent issue. Indian government rejected a UN proposal for the repatriation of Rohingyas and is supplying arms to Myanmar government. As a result, Bangladesh has become totally bogged down in Rohingya crisis.

5231,52494,"Are any countries besides China planning to use ""Fangcang"" hospitals to relocate those infected/suspected of Covid-19, but who have a mild illness?","Somewhat controversially, China has had temporarily relocated those infected with Covid-19 in the Wuhan area to so-called Fangcang hospitals, large communal areas transformed into make-shift hospitals. Although there were up to 13 Fangcang hospitals opened at one point in Wuhan, these were apparently all closed by March 10.


  Fangcang shelter hospitals may seem similar to the makeshift and emergency field hospitals used during previous epidemics in other countries, for example, in the USA during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic, or in African countries during the 2014–15 Ebola epidemic. However, they differ in several important ways. First, the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were established to isolate the patients who were most likely to transmit the infection because they had only mild to moderate COVID-19 and were thus likely to be active in their daily lives and in contact with family and community members. Second, the Fangcang shelter hospitals served an important triage function, separating patients by severity of symptoms, which was not a focus of previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. [...]


These Fangcang hospitals should not be confused with the other kind of emergency hospitals that China had built earlier, for those more seriously sick with Covid-19, such as the Huoshenshan Hospital. (The latter was a prefab hospital with separate rooms.)

I've heard that some countries are already considering converting open-space structures to some kind of emergency/extra hospitals, e.g. as seen in this US footage. While the open-space conversion resembles more a Fangcang than the other type of prefab Chinese hospital, what do know about plans to mass-quarantine the mild cases in such open-space-conversion hospitals elsewhere, i.e. do (any of) these resemble Fangcangs in (intended) function, not just in looks?
",52501,"Yes, several countries are planning to implement this approach, and in some cases, already have. On March 12th, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an EU agency, updated its rapid risk assessment on the COVID-19 pandemic, in which it advises states to 


  designate treatment facilities both for mild and for severe COVID-19 cases with critical care capabilities (e.g. ECMO). This
  implies activation of hospital plans to the highest level to be able to cancel elective diagnostic and operative procedures and
  re-assign human resources, creating temporary treatment facilities for the mild cases or advising self-isolation until
  symptoms improve or worsen.


The WHO also released guidance to this effect on March 17th, reiterating that 


  WHO recommends that all laboratory confirmed cases be isolated and
  cared for in a health care facility.
  
  [...]
  
  If all mild cases cannot be isolated in health facilities, then those
  with mild illness and no risk factors may need to be isolated in
  non-traditional facilities, such as repurposed hotels, stadiums or
  gymnasiums where they can remain until their symptoms resolve and
  laboratory tests for COVID-19 virus are negative.


In Madrid, this advice was implemented with a temporary hospital set up in the IFEMA conference centre. The first patients arrived at the facility on March 21st, and initially had a capacity for 200 patients with 'mild' cases of COVID-19. Capacity will eventually be extended to 1300 beds, with a small number of ICU units in case these mild cases progress to severe cases.

Hotel Vía Castellana has also been converted (article in Spanish) to a temporary hospital for mild cases, with six of the hospital's floors converted to facilities for the lightly ill, and a seventh converted to house medical staff.

In South Korea, this strategy has also been used - the WSJ reports that in order to solve the issue of hospital overcrowding:


  South Korea divided confirmed patients into four categories. Only the
  sickest and elderly went to hospitals. The young and asymptomatic went
  to dormitories, which were lent by Samsung Life Insurance Co., LG
  Display Co. and others, equipped with little more than beds, Wi-Fi and
  the occasional television.
  
  The decision ensured that low-risk individuals remained quarantined
  under government watch. Thousands of South Korea’s virus patients have
  ridden out the past several weeks living in buildings where companies
  typically put up workers for off-site, multiday training.


In the Phillipines, ""Emergency Quarantine Facilities"" (EQFs) are being planned, temporary centres designed for ""patients who are waiting for test results or have mild symptoms but aren’t in dire straits — a way to keep potentially infected people separate from their communities.""

Many countries, however, have chosen not to adopt this strategy, instead advising those with mild to moderate symptoms to self-isolate, prioritising hospital beds, including field hospital beds, for those most at risk or with the worst symptoms. In Singapore, the country had enough hospital capacity to deal with all patients, including those with mild symptoms, due in part to the amount of testing and contact tracing which was used to isolate and quarantine cases.

The supporters could also be a large group. For example, many see politicians who support unbreakable tenure and increasing wages for under performing teachers as cronies of teachers unions. Teachers union cronies, however, are not supporting oligarchs because there are a large number of teachers in society.

  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders are on the ballot in Wisconsin, but the main event is the State Supreme Court race between the conservative incumbent justice, Daniel Kelly, and a liberal challenger, Jill Karofsky.


Wisconsin has an elected state supreme court that currently has 5 conservatives and 2 liberals.  One of the conservatives (Daniel Kelly) is up for election in April 2020, and the another conservative is up in the next election after that (Pat Rogensack, 2023).  If liberals win both of those seats back, they would have a 4-3 majority and could undo the laws that keep the minority Republican party in power.


  The election determined the size of the court's conservative majority. A win for Karofsky would have reduced the conservative majority to 4-3, meaning that the next regularly scheduled election in 2023 would decide control of the court. A Kelly win would have preserved the court's 5-2 conservative majority.
  
  Ballotpedia


It's helpful to understand the political context:


For decades prior to 2010, Wisconsin was a moderate state.  The legislature and governorship each frequently flipped between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Since 1900, Wisconsin has equally chosen Republicans and Democrats for President.
Justices on the state supreme court are elected and technically nonpartisan.  Nonetheless, their conservative versus liberal ideology are often clear.  For decades prior to 2010, the state supreme court held a liberal majority.
It's worth mentioning that long ago, Wisconsin Republicans were leaders in open elections and progressive ideas.  The Republican party started in Wisconsin, as an anti-slavery party (later to be re-started in Michigan).  The word ""progressive"" was coined by Republican Robert La Follette.  Wisconsin was the first or among the first states to adopt women's suffrage, open ballots, primary elections, recall elections, referenda, outlawing child labor, worker's compensation, and income taxes; all were progressive Republican measures.  Prior to the Tea Party, the state was considered one of the most bipartisan and least corrupt states.
Led primarily by Tea Party candidates, in the fall 2010 election, Wisconsin Republicans won control of all three branches of government.  This included the election of Scott Walker as governor, a one-seat majority in the state senate, a considerable margin in the state assembly, and a 4 to 3 majority in the state supreme court.
Republicans quickly enacted a series of laws that would lock in their party's control:


Using sophisticated computer models to draw election maps for the U.S. House, state senate, and state assembly to maximize Republican seats and to pack Democratic votes into few districts.  The gerrymandering is so successful that in the 2018 elections, Republicans won 5 of 8 U.S. House seats with only 45.61% of votes, and 63 of 99 state assembly seats with only 44.75% of votes.
Adopting a voter-ID law.  Minorities and the poor -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are less likely to have the proper types of identification.
Purged 234,000 voters from voting rolls.
Requiring early voting to be performed only at the municipal clerk's office, and not multiple sites.  Thus the 600,000 residents of Milwaukee (a Democratic stronghold) had only one site for early voting, the same as a town of 600 people would.  This law was struck down by a federal judge in 2016.


  
  A requirement that cities can have only one place for early voting. Critics have said large cities such as Milwaukee should be able to have multiple voting sites because not everyone can get downtown easily.
  

Limiting the days and hours for early and absentee voting.
Replacing the agency which oversees elections, from the Government Accountability Board composed of judges chosen by other judges, to the Wisconsin Election Commission chosen by politicians.
Moving the state supreme court elections from the fall (which have high Democratic turnout) to the spring (which have poor Democratic turnout).  This has been particularly effective at increasing the conservative control of the court, from 3-4 in 2010 to 7-2 in 2020.  Note how the election during the pandemic is a spring election, with a supreme court contest.
Holding special elections to fill vacancies on unusual dates -- when Republicans turn out -- instead of the usual fall and spring election dates when Democrats turn out.
After a series of failed recall elections for the governor and Republicans in the state senate, changes that made recalls more difficult (2015 Act 117).
A series of laws (most famously 2011 Act 10) to cripple the power and finances of labor unions, which are the primary backers of Democratic candidates.
In 2015, changing the Chief Justice position from the most senior justice (a liberal) to being chosen by a majority of the court (conservatives).
In 2015, stripping the powers of the Democratic secretary of state.
Increasing the powers of the Republican governor and attorney general.  When Democrats won back these offices in 2018, the powers of those offices were reduced in a lame duck session.

The conservatives controlling the state supreme court have upheld most of the laws described above.  This includes laws that affected the justices' own re-election.  In particular, the decision specifically about whether to continue the election during the pandemic went along ideological lines.
Moderate Republicans were treated poorly by the dominant Tea Party faction.  The previous Republican leaders of the legislature -- Dave Schultz in the assembly and Mike Ellis in the senate -- were pushed out of leadership by Tea Party leaders.  Schultz would later testify in a gerrymandering case that Republicans were brought one-by-one to a law office, and were ordered to vote for the gerrymandered maps, else their own districts would be gerrymandered to make them lose.  In the ensuing years, many moderate Republicans quit the party in disgust, and many moderate office-holders were voted out in primaries by Tea Party candidates.  The loss of moderates had drained the support of the Republican party.
Since 2010, Democrats have been gaining ground.  By number of voters statewide, the Republican party is actually a minority party in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin's top Republican even admitted that they aren't the majority:


  After the Republican Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin Statehouse, said that “if you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.""


However, the measures described above are so effective that the state supreme court and both houses of the state legislature still remain in Republican control.
Democrats swept every statewide office in 2018: U.S. Senate, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and treasurer.  They had more votes in the U.S. House, but because of gerrymandering, they won only 3 of 8 seats.  They also had more votes in the state assembly and gained one seat, but again because of gerrymandering, they did not gain control.
As has happened nationwide, the Wisconsin Republican party has aligned with rural interests and and the Democratic party with urban interests.  COVID-19 is likely to keep people in high-density (i.e. Democratic) districts at home.  Like other rural places in the U.S., rural Wisconsinites believe that COVID-19 is a ""big city"" phenomenon and are likely to show up to the polls.  Per the New York Times, about one of the least populous counties:


  Bruce Johnson, the Democratic chairman in Pepin County, along the state’s western border with Minnesota, said he pushed for absentee balloting but people were less concerned because they rarely wait in lines to vote.


Wikipedia:


  When the election went ahead on 7 April, access to easy in-person voting heavily depended on where voters were located. In smaller or more rural communities, which tend to be whiter and vote Republican, few issues were reported.


It's therefore in the interest of Republicans to keep the election going during the pandemic.
Should liberals take back the state supreme court, they can overturn the system of laws which keeps the Republican party in power.  They would then be at the mercy of the voters, who have been increasingly voting Democratic.

If the tampering was enacted and planned by a foreign country then that country could face sanctions from the US/NATO/UN depending on who it was and what they did.  Any agents could be arrested/deported or have the consular privileges rescinded.  

But being the internet age any problems with the voting probably happened over the internet and the agents could have never set foot in the US.  The US may never be able to prove or even have more than guess work and conjecture about who was pulling the strings behind the curtain.  The US is unlikely to take any action against any significant country unless it can definitively prove that link.  But there are some countries that this might make a great justification for military action.  For instance if it was North Korea, or Syria then you can expect that the military will punish the entire country for the actions of its government.  Or at least that will be the excuse.

5255,52553,What political and social factors underlie Sweden's controversial response to COVID-19?,"Sweden has adopted a far less radical set of policies in reaction to COVID-19 than most other European states. Many other European states are in ""lock-down"", with severe restrictions on people's free movement, with people being advised to only leave their homes for food/medicine. In Sweden, by contrast, people are largely carrying on with their normal lives.


  While every other country in Europe has been ordered into ever more stringent coronavirus lockdown, Sweden has remained the exception. Schools for pupils up to 16 years, kindergartens, bars, restaurants, ski resorts, sports clubs, hairdressers: all remain open, weeks after everything closed down in next door Denmark and Norway.
  
  As the rest of Europe lives under lockdown, Sweden keeps calm and carries on - The Guardian, March 28, 2020


What social and political factors underlie this decision, and why is it so dramatically different to other European countries response?
",52555,"The reason for Sweden's rather hands-off approach compared to other European countries was summed up rather well by lead epidemiologist of the Public Health Agency of Sweden, Anders Tegnell, who said in an interview with CNBC:


  My view is that basically all European countries are trying to do the
  same thing — we’re trying to slow down the spread as much as possible
  to keep healthcare and society working ... and we have shown some
  different methods to slow down the spread, [...] Sweden has gone
  mostly for voluntary measures because that’s how we’re used to
  working, and we have a long tradition that it works rather well.


This tradition of 'laissez-faire-ism' that Tegnell talks about was explored by Johan Norberg in his 2013 essay How Laissez-Faire Made Sweden Rich. This is quite long but well worth a read. Notably, Norberg argues that rather than Sweden's economic and social successes being a result of the SAP ""managing to tax, spend, and regulate Sweden into a more equitable distribution of wealth—without hurting its productive capacity"", Sweden's greatest successes both economically and socially ""took place when Sweden had a laissez-faire economy"".

Sweden's approach to the current pandemic, then, would seem to be influenced by the political traditions of its past. I should note that although Tegnell is hopeful that the current strategy will be successful, he doesn't rule out the implementation of more stringent measures should the data suggest that the laissez-faire tactics are not working.

As far as social factors that have influenced Sweden's response go, one such factor is how sparsely spread its population is. This article from Our World in Data notes how Sweden consistently ranks near the top of metrics related to single-occupant households, and the country also ranks 50th out of 54th for Population Density amongst other European countries.

It is likely that another factor has been the reluctance of the government to negatively affect the economy more than is required. For example, although taking a hands-off approach with regard to restricting personal liberties, it has taken a far more active role in ensuring the continued functioning of business, and on March 27th announced that it will guarantee 70% of bank loans provided to companies that are experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the pandemic.

In conclusion, Sweden's response so far seems to be a combination of the reluctance of Swedes to accept restrictions on personal liberty - note the outcry by opposition parties when a proposal to rule by decree was announced, a tradition of past laissez-faire approaches, and distinct social factors that will potentially help provide a natural defence against the virus.

  What Is the Net Budgetary Impact of the Coverage Provisions Taking Into Account the Supreme Court’s Decision?
  
  CBO and JCT now estimate that the insurance coverage provisions of the ACA will have a net cost of $1,168 billion over the 2012–2022 period—compared with $1,252 billion projected in March 2012 for that 11-year period—for a net reduction of $84 billion. (Those figures do not include the budgetary impact of other provisions of the ACA, which in the aggregate reduce budget deficits.)


The projected net savings to the federal government resulting from the Supreme Court’s decision arise because the reductions in spending from lower Medicaid enrollment are expected to more than offset the increase in costs from greater participation in the newly established exchanges.

5256,52582,Why did the Senate use an existing bill that passed the House in July 2019 to create the CARES Act?,"I was looking at H.R.748 - CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) Act on the Congress website. I was surprised to find that the bill originally passed the House on July 17, 2019. I found this strange because the Coronavirus was not known until the last few months of 2019.

I looked at the original bill from the house. It is fairly short and has nothing to do with Coronavirus, but instead talks about removing a specific tax related to healthcare.

I took a looked at the Senate amendment to the bill. It says, ""Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following:"" This is followed the very lengthy text of the CARES Act. It does not contain any text related to the original purpose of the bill.

Why did the Senate use this bill instead of creating a new one? What happened to the original? Since the Senate replaced it's text, can it no longer fulfill it's original purpose?
",52583,"The reason for amending this bill instead of the Senate creating a new bill was to fulfil the requirements of Article I, Section 7, Clause 1 of the Constitution, also known as the Origination or Revenue clause, which states that all bills for raising revenue must originate within the House of Representatives. Note that despite the Senate seemingly being able to dictate the content of the bill, the House still has to approve the amendment.

The Senate has decided that it is legitimate to fulfil the letter of this clause, if arguably not the spirit, by replacing the entire text of a bill originating in the House with a bill for raising revenue. The constitutionality of this decision has been examined by Rebecca M. Kysar in her 2013 paper The 'Shell Bill' Game: Avoidance and The Origination Clause. In Chapter II, subsection C2, she notes that while the Supreme Court has never ruled on this, several state courts and lower federal courts have condoned this interpretation.

The original bill is now one and the same as the CARES Act, and you are correct in saying that it can no longer fill its original purpose, as the original wording has been completely removed and replaced by the Senate amendment.

This was precisely cited in the gazette notification no. 2652 issued by the Government of India in which they announced the demonetisation:

But to legally terminate RBI’s liability on the banned currencies to prevent future litigation an ordinance has to be passed within certain period of months. As this1 article explains:


  ..although a demonetisation can be done through a notification, a 
  Presidential Ordinance or Parliamentary Act is necessary to:
  
  
  Prohibit transfer or receipt of the banknotes that have ceased to be legal tender, so that these do not reflect anymore as a liability
  on the Issue Department of the Reserve Bank of India.
  Restrict the RBI’s legal obligation to exchange the old notes with new notes.
  
  
  (1) and (2) cannot be done through a notification. They need a
  residential Ordinance or Parliamentary Act. Otherwise, although the
  demonetisation would be legal, the RBI would continue to remain under
  a legal obligation to keep on exchanging the old notes with new ones.


Accordingly the Government of India had drafted an ordinance2 whis was approved by the President of India on 30th Dec 2016.

Have any countries so far announced that they would abolish (or significantly relax) restrictions on drug/vaccine development for the duration of the pandemic?
",52596,"China has also fast-tracked their own vaccine development, with testing in humans (news of March 18):


  CanSino Bio and its collaborators at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences’ Institute of Biotechnology secured a quick Chinese regulatory go-ahead to start human testing of their recombinant coronavirus vaccine, the company said in a disclosure (PDF) to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Wednesday. [...]
  
  The green light was doled out very quickly. It was only Tuesday when CanSino said it had filed the pre-IND review application for the vaccine to authorities and was in the process of a rolling submission of technical documents. [...]
  
  Meanwhile, amid growing numbers of infections in the U.S., the FDA has allowed a phase 1 study of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine without animal data. On Monday, the biotech said researchers at the National Institutes of Health dosed the first subject. [...]
  
  Besides CanSino and Moderna, many other companies are also working on vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. [...]


I cannot tell you how much ""bending of the rules"" this is in China, since I'm not familiar with their regulations.  But the timing of the Chinese announcement was roughly two days later after the US announced the first Moderna vaccine dose having been injected into a human (on March 16). Interestingly perhaps, China is also developing a mRNA vaccine ""jointly developed by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Tongji University and Stermina in Shanghai"", but this one is still undergoing animal testing in China, with human testing announced to begin mid-April.

So yeah, the US (NIAID/Moderna) and China (CanSino) are now basically in a ""race for the [vaccine] cure"". Others will probably join. I suspect they might also benefit from regulatory fast-tracks, possibly depending how well politically connected they are in their test jurisdictions. (The EU has given Curevac a grant to work on a mRNA vaccine similar to the Moderna one; however no human tests have begun with that--they've been announced for June. The WHO said that over 40 concrete vaccine candidates have been proposed, with at least a hundred in development.)

The WSJ reported (without a lot of specifics on the regulatory side that):


  Counting drugs approved for other diseases, there are 254 clinical trials testing treatments or vaccines for the virus, many spearheaded by universities and government research agencies, with hundreds more trials planned. Researchers have squeezed timelines that usually total months into weeks or even days.

5285,52610,What did the US CDC say about COVID-19 human-to-human transmission between Jan 14 and 21?,"From (answers to) a related question, the WHO had mostly changed their public stance on the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 after Jan 22, while giving mostly ""negative signals"" on this matter of human-to-human transmission before Jan 22.

Interestingly, on Jan 17, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) put out a rapid report saying that: 


  The occurrence of a few cases having no history of contact with the implicated market
  or other any similar market suggests the possibility of the infection source being more widely distributed, or of human-to-human transmission similar to other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The occurrence of a few family clusters also supports this latter hypothesis. However, there is currently no knowledge on the transmission mode or risk factors for transmission. Furthermore, there is no information on the disease spectrum or risk factors for severity. In light of these unknowns, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level virus circulation in the Wuhan community and thus the possibility of other clusters occurring in the near future. [...]
  
  
  There is a high likelihood of case importation in countries with the greatest volume of people travelling to and from Wuhan (i.e. countries in Asia).
  There is a low likelihood of importation of cases in EU/EEA countries, due to the less extensive traffic of people with Wuhan. 
  


For comparison, what did the US CDC say on this matter (human-to-human transmission) within this period (i.e between Jan 14 and 21), and did they also asses back then (like the ECDC did) the likelihood of importation into the US?



Insofar I was able to find, by Jan 31, the US CDC was clearly convinced of human-to-human transmission:


  On January 31, 2020, CDC published updated PUI guidance (8) in response to the evolving global epidemiology of 2019-nCoV, including the rapid geographic expansion and documentation of person-to-person transmission (9). Updated guidance emphasizes 2019-nCoV testing for symptomatic persons in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, persons returning from Hubei province in addition to Wuhan City, and persons from mainland China requiring hospitalization because of fever and lower respiratory tract illness. Additional refinements to this approach likely will be needed in the future as understanding of 2019-nCoV epidemiology continues to improve.


But what did they say roughly two weeks earlier, before the WHO had confirmed human-to-human transmission?
",52613,"On January 17th, the CDC announced that COVID-19 screening would begin at ""three U.S. airports that receive most of the travelers from Wuhan, China: San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports.""

They also state in this press release that:


  CDC is actively monitoring this situation for pertinent information
  about the source of outbreak, and risk for further spread through
  person-to-person or animal-to-person transmission. CDC may adjust
  screening procedures and other response activities as this outbreak
  investigation continues and more is learned about the newly emerging
  virus. Entry screening alone is not a guarantee against the possible
  importation of this new virus but is an important public health tool
  during periods of uncertainty and part of a multilayered government
  response strategy. As new information emerges, CDC will reassess entry
  screening measures and could scale activities up or down accordingly.


This indicates that an assessment of the likelihood of importation of the virus into the US was completed, and a decision was made that only the airports with the largest amount of traffic needed to be screened. They do however note that this is not a guarantee that the virus will not be imported. Further on in the briefing, they mention that:


  China health officials report that most of the patients infected with
  2019-nCoV have had exposure to a large market where live animals were
  present, suggesting this is a novel virus that has jumped the species
  barrier to infect people. Chinese authorities additionally report that
  several hundred health care workers caring for outbreak patients are
  being monitored and no spread of this virus from patients to health
  care workers has been seen. They report no sustained spread of this
  virus in the community, however there are indications that some
  limited person-to-person spread may have occurred. CDC is responding
  to this outbreak out of an abundance of caution, ready to detect
  people infected with 2019-CoV.


This briefing suggests that while the CDC was preparing for human-to-human transmission to be confirmed, and may have even thought that this was likely, it did not have the data to confirm this.

Later on, on the 21st, the CDC released another briefing after the first COVID-19 positive patient was identified in the US. The briefing notes that the patient returned from China on the 15th, before the screening mentioned above was implemented. This release, however also does not state that human-to-human transmission is confirmed, but mentions that


  While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there
  are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is
  happening. It’s unclear how easily this virus is spreading between
  people.


At this point the CDC also implemented screening at two more airports, Atlanta and Chicago.

It seems clear, therefore, that the CDC did not have access to data which confirmed human-to-human transmission, although the steps taken to implement health screening at airports, and the advice given to healthcare providers on January 8th indicates that it certainly thought that the likelihood of this was great. Clearly the health screening also proves that spread from Wuhan was seen as a possibility, although we can infer from the fact that this was initially only set up at three airports that this was either not seen as a large possibility, or that the spread via air-travel was not expected to be high enough to warrant a complete lock-down.

",52617,"India is a large producer of Hydroxychloroquine because, prior to the promotion of the drug as a potential treatment for COVID-19, its most widespread use was as an anti-malarial drug. India has, according to the WHO's World malaria report 2019, the largest proportion of malaria cases outside of Africa:


  Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India carried almost
  85% of the global malaria burden.


The report also notes that India is the only one of the ""high burden to high impact"" countries (basically countries most affected by malaria) to have significant domestic investment into dealing with the disease compared to the reliance on international aid. This has manifested itself in the form of pharmaceutical manufacturers which can supply India with its domestic demand for the drug, such as Zydus Cadila and Ipca Laboratories.

This Forbes article notes that these companies in particular have significant capacity to ramp up production:


  “The priority is to manufacture this drug versus anything else,” says
  Sharvil Patel, managing director at Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila,
  which had $1.9 billion in revenues in fiscal 2019. “We have ramped up
  our production of hydroxychloroquine from 3 metric tons per month to
  20 to 30 metric tons per month and can scale it up further to 40 to 50
  metric tons if there is a requirement.”
  
  Ipca Labs, which has 20-metric-ton capacity, can produce 100 million
  tablets a month. “The Indian government has placed a significant
  order,” says Ajit Kumar Jain, joint managing director of Ipca Labs.
  “We can increase our manufacturing capacity to 26 metric tons in a
  month or two. We are also simultaneously ramping up our packing and
  labelling lines.”
  
  [...]
  
  Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical
  Alliance, an industry group, says that “the domestic demand is 3
  million tablets a month but we have the capacity to go up to 150
  million to 200 million tablets a month easily.” He adds that “it is
  very difficult to predict demand going forward because we do not know
  how many will be affected.”


This is, of course, on top of the underlying fact that India is, according to Raconteur, the largest provider of generic drugs globally, with its pharmaceutical industry is growing by 7 to 8 per cent a year, with growth of 11 to 13 percent expected in 2020.

It seems that India's prominence in the manufacture of the drug is due to existing infrastructure due to high existing domestic demand, and a strong underlying pharmaceutical industry, giving it the ability to quickly scale up production levels.

It can also mean to wait for the mahdi, the person in charge of establishing an islamic state before the final judgement (who may be a ""reincarnation"" of the prophet, I am not sure about that, I confess that religion uses words without enough clarity behind them for me).

Second option: care. It can mean to engage in politics, like what some salafists did after the egyptian relovution. They got engaged in politics separately from the already in place islamist parties. In Tunisia, some founded the party Jahbat al islah. Or, it can also mean wage a holy war, what is usually called ""jihadi salafism"".

Note that there is an ambiguity with the term ""jihad"", since some people are calling to reform its meaning. There is none with the term ""holy war"" or with the activities of the list of groups mentioned in the wikipedia article for ""salafi jihadi"".

As for ""who are they"" like in a list of names and their locations, I think a lot of governments would like to know this...

5289,52625,"Why is the CARES Act necessary, when the Federal Reserve has spent way more than $2T?","On Mar 12 2020, US Federal Reserve injected ""$1.5T of liquidity into the markets, rather than that amount of money"".
 On Mar 18, CARES Act came into force and  will pay out $2 trillion USD.
On Apr  8  the Federal Reserve released minutes from meeting where it took rates to zero because of coronavirus


  Miller said he expects the Fed balance sheet, currently just shy of $6 trillion, to expand to $10 trillion or more.


On Apr 9, the Federal Reserve will print $2.3 trillion USD to buy junk bonds and lend to states in a new wave of stimulus.

My questions


Why did Congress need the CARES Act? Why didn't it just recommend that the Federal Reserve spend $2T USD, which looks  way easier? I know that the Federal Reserve is autonomous and Congress can't order the Federal Reserve to do anything.
Similarly, Senate Democrats block $250 billion in small business relief, accuse McConnell of a ""political stunt"" : politics. Why didn't Congress Members just recommend the Fed spend another $250B,?
As you can see from the points above, both sides criticized and haggled before enacting the CARES Act. But the Federal Reserve has spent way more than $2.250T! Isn't this a contradiction? Why haven't Congress Members criticized or haggled the Federal Reserve like Democrats and Republicans are criticizing each other in Congress? 
Doesn't the CARES Act prove that the Fed isn't spending, or hasn't spent, enough money on the the right people?  If the Fed was giving money to the right people, then would the US need the CARES Act? 

",52626,"Broadly speaking, the Fed can only keep markets liquid by doing things like buying assets or making loans to banks against assets owned by the banks.  That's awesome if you're worried that mortgage-backed securities are tanking in value and the Fed can come along and prop up their value until the panic is over.  That's a concern today but it was a much bigger concern back in 2008 when the housing bubble burst. 
 It is useless if your goal is to get money into the hands of people or small businesses that need it to pay rent or pay their mortgages today.  If Congress wants to get money to those folks, it has to pass legislation to spend the money.

Fed spending is also very different from Congressional spending because the Fed is generally buying (or lending against) assets, it's not generating spending that drives demand.  Most of the Fed's $1.5 T involves going to banks that have some assets and saying ""Hey, nice assets.  We'd love to give you a cheap loan if you put those assets up as collateral.""  That ensures that banks have plenty of money on hand to be able to lend out and ensures that there is a willing buyer for whatever assets the Fed is lending against.  Eventually, though, banks are going to give the Fed back that $1.5 T with a small bit of interest.

8137,50518,Is there an official assessment of the side-effects of a quarantine for COVID-19 in US or in China?,"Given the lack of critical assessment in the US media of China's massive quarantine, I think that there are many people in the US who would view it acceptable to shut down a major American city to prevent the spreading of an outbreak.  However, I worry that no one is considering the consequences of such action.  

With major parts of the economy no longer functioning, people would have difficulty with things like finding child care.  This has trickle down effects, such as pharmacy staff staying at home with their children.  This may lead to lethal consequences.  

Examples of trickle down effects:


Cancer survivors can't access health care (this is currently happening in China). 
Lack of access to medicine.  This can be deadly to people with severe chronic conditions (e.g. heart disease).
Lack of social support (e.g. no one is checking in on Grandma).


Question: 

Do policy makers (in either China or the US) consider the unintended consequences of large quarantines?  If so whose advising them and studying those effects?  Is the decision to quarantine based off of a process or is it based off of an executive leader's 'intuition'.  

My 'intuition' is that these unintentional effects may be killing more people than covid 19.

",50557,"In the US there are two federal agencies the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Emergency Management Agency that have larges staffs of physicians, epidemiologists, public health, and disaster management professionals. Those staffs spend a lot of their time worrying about questions like this, and gaming out different scenarios, just like the military games out battle strategies. There is also a large academic community of public health specialists that study problems like this. See for example these academic papers:

Quarantine, isolation and the duty of easy rescue in public health


  We address the issue of whether, why and under what conditions,
  quarantine and isolation are morally justified, with a particular
  focus on measures implemented in the developing world. We argue that
  the benefits of quarantine and isolation justify some level of
  coercion or compulsion by the state, but that the state should be able
  to provide the strongest justification possible for implementing such
  measures.


The Challenge Of Mandatory Evacuation: Providing For And Deciding For


  Insufficient attention has been given to the ethical and legal
  questions surrounding mandatory evacuation in disasters and
  emergencies. We argue that mandatory evacuation orders entail a
  governmental duty both to provide for people and to decide for people:
  Government must trigger the provision of critical resources as well as
  vigorous and persistent efforts to persuade reluctant citizens to
  leave.


Of course the political powers might choose to not to follow the advice of their professional staff or outside professionals, but that comes with grave political risks if the situation goes south. The political powers might also receive contradictory advice from different groups of professionals. Which experts should they listen to?

There is also the chance that even with the best of intentions and the best available information, the experts will make the wrong call, or apply the ""lessons of the last battle"" in the wrong situation. 

These are hard questions. For example, in In August 2005 Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and over 1800 people were killed. The governments of Louisiana and New Orleans we broadly criticized for not fully evacuating the city. Later in 2005 Hurricane Rita was projected to hit Houston and a mandatory evacuation was ordered. Dozens of people died in the evacuation of Houston, from heat stroke, accidents, and a tragic bus fire. As it turned out, Hurricane Rita struck Houston only a passing blow, and fewer people died in the storm than in the evacuation. New lesson learned: don't evacuate, shelter in place, evacuate only those most at risk. Then in 2017 Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, causing massive flooding, and requiring the rescue of thousands of people trapped in floodwaters. And afterwards everyone was asking Why Didn't Houston Evacuate?.

Predicting the future is hard.

8255,50597,How would next U.S. President be determined if there was a national emergency that significantly disrupted voting in many states?,"This sort of builds up on this and this previous question. Both of them ask about if the President can block the transfer of their office to a successor.

In response to the current Coronavirus pandemic, many states are encouraging people to use “social distancing” methods and canceling large public events to prevent the spread of the disease. With large numbers of people using the same voting booths and voting machines, in-person voting seems like it could provide an effective vector for the spread of the disease, and if the pandemic continues to get worse it’s possible to imagine in-person voting being significantly disrupted.

In this situation, what would happen if the coronavirus (or another pandemic) significantly disrupted in-person voting for the Presidential election? Would the election be delayed, or are there mechanisms to enforce a change in voting methods? In this kind of hypothetical situation, how would the successor of the U.S. President be (s)elected?
",50614,"First, this has never really happened in the United States. In extreme emergencies and national disasters, elections have been held a few days late, but never suspended (unlike, for example, the United Kingdom, that suspended elections during World War II). Elections were also not canceled during the Civil War, or as a result of the War of 1812 (during which the U.S. capitol was burned to the ground by foreign military forces).

For example, elections were not prevented from being conducted by the Spanish flu of 1918 which was in all respects deadlier and more contagious than the coronavirus, despite the fact that the technology available for a response in 1918 was less advanced.

Realistically, you would need a disease that is catastrophic on the scale of the Black Plague in medieval Europe (that killed a third to a half of the population in many places), and not merely something like the coronavirus (with a 2% mortality rate), to take out the electoral process in the U.S.

A situation like that would involve the collapse of the entire regime and government, and would send us into uncharted waters.

Second, election laws can be changed quite quickly in an emergency. One could, for example, shift as Colorado has, to a system of near complete all mail in ballots, to reduce the amount of in person interactions that were needed.

The U.S. Constitution does not provide the option of not conducting an election. In the absence of an election, elected offices become vacant and the succession provisions of the law which usually kick in when there is a death during someone's term of office would kick in. U.S. Senate vacancies can be filled in most states by Governors on a temporary basis. U.S. House seats that go vacant must be filled in vacancy elections. There is a line of succession to the Presidency defined by law involving a few key Congressional leaders and the cabinet.
",Reasonable,"According to this article How to mislead with statistics, DHS Secretary Nielsen edition reported on June 18, 2018


  “The kids are being used as pawns by the smugglers and the
  traffickers,” Nielsen said.
  
  “Again, let’s just pause to think about this statistic: 314 percent
  increase in adults showing up with kids that are not a family unit,”
  she said. “Those are traffickers, those are smugglers, that is MS-13,
  those are criminals, those are abusers.”
  
  A DHS representative provided The Washington Post with the hard
  numbers behind Nielsen’s statistic. There were 46 cases of fraud —
  “individuals using minors to pose as fake family units” — in fiscal
  2017, the period from October 2016 through September 2017. In the
  first five months of 2018, there were 191 cases.
  
  That is an increase of 315 percent.


It is not immediately clear what the numbers are specifically related to human trafficking arrests, see U.S. Border Patrol Southwest Border Apprehensions by Sector FY2018 for the raw data. According to statistics for 2016 at Human Trafficking - ICE 


  In fiscal year 2016, HSI initiated 1,029 investigations with a nexus
  to human trafficking and recorded 1,952 arrests, 1,176 indictments,
  and 631 convictions; 435 victims were identified and assisted.


and Border arrests exceed 50,000 for third month in a row.

The most recent Bureau of Justice Statistics data as to human trafficking is for 2015 Federal Prosecution of Human-Trafcking Cases, 2015, where the total number was reported to be 1,923 total persons referred for human trafficking prosecution


  In fscal year 2015, 1,923 suspects were referred to U.S. attorneys
  with human trafcking as the lead charge—39% for peonage, slavery,
  forced labor or sex trafcking; 32% for production of child
  pornography; and 29% for transportation for illegal sex activity. This
  was a 41% increase from the 1,360 suspects referred to U.S. attorneys
  in 2011.


It is important to note the conflicting reports that have been issued as to the subject matter of human trafficking, see 2018 NCVRW Resource Guide: Human Trafficking Fact Sheet


  In FY 2016, DOJ initiated 241 federal human trafficking prosecutions
  and charged 531 defendants. Of these prosecutions, nearly 95% were
  predominantly related to sex trafficking. DOJ also secured convictions
  against 439 traffickers in FY 2016. Of those convicted, 97% were
  primarily involved in sex trafficking.


and the disclaimer of the data held within the report


  Human trafficking is difficult to measure. Fear of harm to self or
  others, language barriers, lack of personal freedom, and fear of law
  enforcement often prevent victims from reporting their victimization
  or seeking services. Additionally, multiple agencies are charged with
  investigating and prosecuting human trafficking cases, at both the
  federal and state level, and providing services to victims. The
  record-keeping systems across these agencies may not allow for
  cross-referencing, and some victims may appear in the records of
  multiple agencies. Because of this, human trafficking reports should
  not be used to make generalizations about the scale or scope of human
  trafficking in the United States.


where ""human trafficking"" can be divided into at least several categories including ""labor trafficking"" and ""sex trafficking"". 

It is not clear if the question attempts to distinguish between sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or human trafficking without any forced attached sex or labor after the ""victim"" or ""illegal immigrant"", depending on the perspective is successfully trafficked into the United States; for example, a family paying a trafficker to get them to the U.S. without being forced into sex or labor, or if the premise is that all human trafficking involves forced sex and labor.

What is clear is that the total prosecutions for human trafficking arrests at the border is a substantially low percentage of the total ""border arrests"".

According to Southwest Border Migration FY2018 a total of 145393 persons have been apprehended between April 2018 and June 2018. Correlating the total number of individuals charged with human trafficking for the entire year of 2018 to the publication date of the Washington Post article How to mislead with statistics, DHS Secretary Nielsen edition, we have 191.

Thus, the math is 

(191 / 145393) * 100 = 0.13136808512101683

travel for work (for instance, plumbers can go visit their clients).
commute between different cities for work reasons.

return to your main residence (wherever you are).
go tend to elderly relatives.
divorced parents can go visit their children.
dispose of trash.
walk your dog (EDIT: in some regions, this was further restricted: one cannot go further than 200m from one's house for this reason), or take it to the vet for urgent matters.
go running or practicing (individual) sports (EDIT: in some regions, this was further restricted: one cannot go further than 200m from one's house for this reason).
use a bike for an authorized purpose (e.g., as a sport, or to commute).
there is no limitation to the number, length, or frequency of outside trips, as long as they are all for authorized reasons.


What you cannot do


if you have fever or other symptoms it is ""strongly recommended"" to stay at home.
go to a secondary place of residence such as a a holiday home.
go for a walk without any other purpose.
all kind of gatherings: discos, cinemas, pubs, theaters, etc. are closed.
all schools and universities are closed.
religious gatherings are suspended (e.g. Sunday mass).
""non-essential"" (see above) shops are closed.


What happens to transgressors

Police can stop people to check that they are out for a legitimate purpose. Transgressors can be arrested (up to 3 months) or fined (up to 206€), and the violation will enter their criminal record. Shops that disobey regulations will be closed for 5 up to 30 days. 

Numerous violations have already been reported: this newspaper article mentions 46000 violations reported by the authorities and 1500 closed shops in the past week of lockdown.

",Reasonable,"It is considered so serious that the Equality and Human Rights Commission has opened an investigation into it (the EHRC will report in 2020). Initially:


  Having received a number of complaints regarding antisemitism in the
  Labour Party, we believe the Labour Party may have unlawfully
  discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious
  beliefs.
  
  Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory
  enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now
  engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond


Then:


  We contacted The Labour Party after receiving a number of complaints
  about allegations of antisemitism in the party.
  
  We have carefully considered the response we have received from the
  Party and have opened a formal investigation.
  
  We are using our powers under the Equality Act to open an
  investigation, which will look at:
  
  
  whether unlawful acts have been committed by the Party or its employees or agents
  the steps taken by the Party to implement the recommendations made in the reports on antisemitism by Baroness Royall, the Home Affairs
  Select Committee and in the Chakrabarti Report
  whether the Rule Book and the Party’s investigatory and disciplinary processes have enabled or could enable it to deal
  efficiently and effectively with complaints of race or religion or
  belief discrimination and racial harassment or victimisation,
  including whether appropriate sanctions have been or could be applied
  whether the Party has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner
  


Labour is the first political party to be the subject of a formal EHRC investigation into institutional racism since the inquiry into the neo-Nazi British National Party (probably rather fewer surprises in that report). 

The Labour Against Anti-Semitism group claims to have submitted 15,000 pages of evidence that more than a thousand Labour members are anti-semitic and that the party has failed to take proper action. 

In an article for the Times titled, ""The way in which the leadership of the Labour Party has dealt with anti-Jewish racism is incompatible with the British values of which we are so proud"", The Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, has also weighed in. No Chief Rabbi has commented on a general election before like this. 

In 2016, Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee ran an inquiry into anti-semitism in the UK and devoted a substantial part of their report to the Labour party. The Committee found ""no reliable, empirical evidence to support the notion that there is a higher prevalence of antisemitic attitudes within the Labour Party than any other political party"" - indeed it's by no means the worst - but said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally antisemitic"". 

The Committee criticised the Chakrabati Inquiry report into anti-semitism in the Labour party published earlier in the same year, describing it as ""compromised"", and said Corbyn didn't understand ""the distinct nature of post-second-world-war antisemitism"".


  Clearly, the Labour Leader is not directly responsible for abuse
  committed in his name, but we believe that his lack of consistent
  leadership on this issue, and his reluctance to separate antisemitism
  from other forms of racism, has created what some have referred to as
  a ‘safe space’ for those with vile attitudes towards Jewish people.
  This situation has been further exacerbated by the Party’s
  demonstrable incompetence at dealing with members accused of
  antisemitism, as illustrated by the saga involving the suspension,
  re-admittance and re-suspension of Jackie Walker. The ongoing
  membership of Ken Livingstone, following his outbursts about Hitler
  and Zionism, should also have been dealt with more effectively. The
  result is that the Labour Party, with its proud history of fighting
  racism and promoting equal rights, is seen by some as an unwelcoming
  place for Jewish members and activists.
  
  The decision by the Leader of the Labour Party to commission an
  independent inquiry into antisemitism was a welcome one,
  notwithstanding subsequent criticisms. The Chakrabarti report makes
  recommendations about creating a more robust disciplinary process
  within the Labour Party, but it is clearly lacking in many areas;
  particularly in its failure to differentiate explicitly between racism
  and antisemitism. The fact that the report describes occurrences of
  antisemitism merely as “unhappy incidents” also suggests that it fails
  to appreciate the full gravity of the comments that prompted the
  inquiry in the first place. These shortfalls, combined with Ms
  Chakrabarti’s decision to join the Labour Party in April and accept a
  peerage as a nominee of the Leader of that Party, and her subsequent
  appointment as Shadow Attorney General, have thrown into question her
  claims (and those of Mr Corbyn) that her inquiry was truly
  independent. Ms Chakrabarti has not been sufficiently open with the
  Committee about when she was offered her peerage, despite several
  attempts to clarify this issue with her. It is disappointing that she
  did not foresee that the timing of her elevation to the House of
  Lords, alongside a report absolving the Labour Leader of any
  responsibility for allegations of increased antisemitism within his
  Party, would completely undermine her efforts to address this issue.
  It is equally concerning that Mr Corbyn did not consider the damaging
  impression likely to be created by this sequence of events.


For an organisation to be institutionally racist, we don't mean that every member is racist or even most members are racist, or that there is intent in the organisation to be racist - it is about outcomes. If the totality of the body's efforts (their complaints, procedures, investigations, disciplinaries etc) or lack of efforts lead to racist outcomes, it's institutionally racist. 


  ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate
  and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or
  ethnic origin"", which ""can be seen or detected in processes,
  attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through
  unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist
  stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people."" - Sir
  William Macpherson


There is a not unfounded perception that Labour has, over time, been very slow to investigate, failed to take action against anti-semitic members, ignored the problem, denied the existence of the problem, doubled down on causing the bad outcomes, blamed the complainants and even driven some of the complainants out of the party.

In April 2019 the Sunday Times published a story headed, ""Labour’s hate files expose Jeremy Corbyn’s anti‑semite army"" (paywall):


  The Labour Party has failed to take disciplinary action against
  hundreds of members accused of anti-semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s
  leadership, according to internal documents leaked to The Sunday
  Times.
  
  A hard drive of emails and a confidential database last updated on
  March 8 reveal how the party’s system for dealing with such complaints
  is bedevilled by delays, inaction and interference from the leader’s
  office. They reveal members investigated for posting such online
  comments as “Heil Hitler”, “F*** the Jews” and “Jews are the problem”
  have not been expelled, even though the party received the complaints
  a year ago.


The newspaper claimed the leaks showed that more than half of the cases remained unresolved to March 2019 and in 28% of them there had been no investigation.

In July 2019, BBC's Panorama reported in a programme titled “Is Labour Antisemitic?” (iPlayer link) reported among other things that Corbyn’s general secretary Jennie Formby, chief of staff Karie Murphy, director of strategy Seumas Milne and adviser Andrew Murray meddled in what were supposed to be independent investigations, overruling and downgrading penalties. It appeared to be a party concerned with damage control instead of investigating complaints.

Worse, Corbyn himself has often seemed to believe there hasn't been a problem or not cared if there was. He has also shared platforms with anti-semitic people, such as proponents of killing Jews (e.g. Hamas and Hezbollah) and even supported them. I think that in those respects, as in the IRA involvement, Corbyn's political judgment on this has been spectacularly poor for an MP and would-be PM. As the-then Labour Chief Whip said of Corbyn inviting two convicted IRA terrorists to Parliament two weeks after the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing: 


  I think that, unless you are very very careful, any contact with
  people of this sort gives credence to their cause, and unless you are
  very careful that can lead to people thinking you are actually
  indifferent to the outrage, the suffering, the killing and the maiming
  which is the direct consequence of the actions of people who are
  terrorists.


Corbyn once supported Blood Libel proponent Raed Salah, for example. Corbyn has denied being aware that such individuals have made antisemitic remarks but their remarks and affiliations have been a matter of public record - he could have looked into the people he was to support or share a platform with. So at best he was utterly careless about who he supported. Here is a timeline of some of his behaviour, some of which beggars belief.

This caused nearly ever major event to be cancelled and caused tremendous losses for the economy. But is there already a long term plan on bringing the economy back to life? Surely countries cannot just live in quarantine forever? 

Only notable exception that I'm aware of is Boris Johnson announcing that the UK will be following a different approach:


  Defending Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision not to follow other European countries by closing schools and banning mass gatherings, Patrick Vallance said it was the government’s aim to “reduce the peak of the epidemic, pull it down and broaden it” while protecting the elderly and vulnerable


So the UK's long term plan seems to be ""business as usual"", but what about others?

Germany has pretty supportive laws in place for people who are personally quarantined, basically paid sick days off. This will have the effect of supporting domestic demand during the crisis.
That does not cover the general economic downturn for people who are not directly sick or quarantined, so the government decided on tax deferments and a loan program for businesses.
There is also the possibility of payments from the unemployment insurance system for workers who had their working hours reduced, this allows companies to avoid layoffs.

8759,51052,How can a ban on people gathering be enforced when it is imposed for an epidemic?,"I noticed that a lot of countries introducing quarantines and other measures to fight COVID-19 also included a ban on people gathering. I am wondering, how can it be enforced?

When a government wants to stop people protests and similar actions the ban can be easily enforced, because protesters must put themselves in evidence otherwise their protest would have no purpose. But in the case of an epidemic the ban should prevent also people gathering in a discreet manner in a backstreet or a public garden. No country, not even the authoritarian ones have enough policemen to monitor every single corner. 

Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison? Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?

Last detail if there are limits in the way a ban can be enforced. How effective can a ban be at preventing public gatherings? 

Edit: 

I would like to point out something that none of the answers considers. When a government gives an order, or issues a prohibition, then they have to enforce it, it is also a strong commitment for the state itself. This means devoting a large portion of the police force to it while they could have been employed for other tasks. Furthermore the stronger the prohibition the higher the chance that some people may eventually challenge it and lead to confrontations with the police forces.

Had there been just a ban on public events plus a recommendation to people not to gather in big number, without such a strong commitment, what would have been the difference in effectiveness and pressure put on the police force and other state resources?
",51053,"
  I am wondering, how can it be enforced?


By the authorities, wielding the law and their monopoly on the use of force. I think society, the mainstream media and social media will also create social pressure and consequences.

Obviously the effectiveness of the ban depends on the proportion of people abiding by it. That a minority will inevitably flout the ban does not mean the ban is wholly useless.


  Furthermore if people violate the ban and refuse to pay the fine, what
  are they going to do? Put them in a crowded prison?


Yes, ban violators might be imprisoned.

  Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?


If the person is not infected, the prisoners are no worse off. If the person is infected, perhaps he or she can be put in solitary confinement or a repurposed toilet paper warehouse. Whether the person is infected or not infected, society is better off. 

There is no country on the planet that can cope with large proportions of their populations being hospitalised (particularly if they need intensive care or mechanical ventilation), which is one of the things that such a ban is intended to reduce the risk of.

Depends on the country. In China, some types of breaking the quarantine result in execution. That's not a joke.

In some other countries (e.g. South Korea, Singapore) you may be charged with manslaughter, criminal neglect, public endangerment and similar crimes.

",51081,"This has been explored by Berens et al. [1], from the Reputation Institute, the publishers of the annual RepTrak country reputation rankings. In their chapter in the International Place Branding Yearbook 2011, they provide an overview of their methodology, which seeks to measure a country's reputation in much the same way that one might measure the reputation of an individual or a company. 

They argue that this reputation is linked intrinsically to the overall international trust of a country, something which is backed up by Klewes &amp; Wreschniok [2], which states that the link between reputation and trust is ""fundamental and indispensable"", arguing that "" trust is based on the experience
that an agent has fulfilled our expectations in the past.""

They list 11 different attributes, which fit into three different dimensions. These are:


Advanced Economy


An important contributor to global culture
Is technologically advanced
Is inventive
Produces high-quality products and services

Appealing Environment


Offers appealing lifestyle
An enjoyable country
A beautiful country

Effective Government 


Offers a favorable environment for doing business
Has adopted progressive social and economic policies
Is a responsible participant in the global community
Is run by an effective government



The testing methodology consisted of a large random sample (n=26,000) of consumers in the G8 countries, combined with an additional sample (n=19,000) from the country in question drawn from its own citizens. Responses were adjusted to take into account general per-country bias - for example, respondents from Greece generally will have a good opinion of Cyprus.

A further dimension which was measured was ""Supportive Behaviors"". This measured the willingness of consumers to visit, live in, invest in, work in, and buy products from the country.

In conclusion then, while the study in question is conducted by surveying populations, it seems possible that a similar study could be conducted which measures at least some of these criteria objectively. Certainly, factors such as ""willingness to invest"" and ""technological advancement"" could be measured using economic data. However, it would seem that the best way to measure the reputation of a country will probably be to survey the opinions of global respondents through large-scale polling, as the factors that the study found had the most effect on a country's reputation were attributes such as ""Offers an appealing lifestyle"", ""Is a responsible participant in the global community"", and ""Is a beautiful country"", which would seem to be more abstract factors.

",Reasonable,"Because the two main parties absorb emergent third parties

Any time any third party starts to get serious traction in the United States, it eventually will find one of the major parties shifting its platform to absorb those voters into its coalition.

Unlike most of the other parties in America, the Democrats and the Republicans are both in the business of winning elections. Allowing a third party to just show up someplace would be political malpractice of the highest order. The smart thing to do is to go straight to those voters and say ""I know the New Center Party is offering you X, we can give you X also, and we have the additional benefit of being a real governing party that can actually make that happen."" So, that's typically what happens. 

Ever heard of the Reform Party? It was founded by Ross Perot, who got 18.6% of the popular vote for President in 1992, and 8.1% of the popular vote in 1996. It tried to be a centrist alternative to the two other parties, and it may have cost George H. W. Bush re-election (who, it should be noted, committed political malpractice of the highest order by promising no new taxes, and then passing new taxes, thereby making a lot of his voters angry). You may have heard of some of their more famous Presidential candidates: Pat Buchanan and Donald Trump. 

Those two guys are Republicans now, and at the same time, what the Republican Party is about changed quite a bit, and is still in the process of changing. The Reform Party was in favor of reducing immigration; before Donald Trump, many Republican politicians wanted to increase legal immigration through comprehensive immigration reform. The Reform Party was opposed to this thing called the North American Free Trade Agreement; before Trump, many Republican politicians were in favor of free trade agreements as part of a commitment to free market economics. 

The GOP saw in 1992 that there was 18.6% of the voters in the country who wanted an alternative to the other parties that they could pick up, so they expanded their tent to try to pick them up; 24 years later all of those voters who still think that way are Republican voters for Donald Trump.

This is just one worked example; other historical examples are the Progressive Party at the turn of the century, and anything that could have become a successful US Communist party.

Why didn't this happen with the Libertarian Party or the Green Party or any of those other parties you mentioned? Simple; they are not very popular, in part because most of the people who might find them ideologically pleasing are probably already voting for Republicans or Democrats just to get their achievable policy goals accomplished. So, they continue as vanity projects for rich donors and that stubborn guy who just can't let anyone be wrong on the Internet.

Also, not ""identifying with"" a party doesn't mean people will not vote for it

Just because most people don't want to identify themselves as Republicans or Democrats, doesn't mean that they actually aren't willing to vote for them. It is a well known social science phenomena that most people who call themselves independents are actually moderate partisans. That is, they may say they're independent, but that doesn't mean they're as ready to jump ship for a center third party.

  Considering today's assertion that FDA has now approved certain pharms, does it follow that these prescriptions are no longer ""off-label"", but rather are indicated uses?


No.  The president is not the FDA, and the president's statements about FDA actions are not FDA actions.  The only official source of information about drug approvals is the FDA's list of approved drugs.  See 21 CFR 314.3:


  Listed drug is a new drug product that has been approved under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for safety and effectiveness or under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has not been withdrawn or suspended under section 505(e)(1) through (5) or section 505(j)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and which has not been withdrawn from sale for what FDA has determined are reasons of safety or effectiveness. Listed drug status is evidenced by the drug product's identification in the current edition of FDA's “Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (the list) as an approved drug. A drug product is deemed to be a listed drug on the date of approval for the NDA or ANDA for that drug product.

  The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.


The Constitution provides no other guidance on the limitations of an charge of impeachment.

As to the trial of an impeachment trial, the Constitution is likewise very concise:


  The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.


As to the penalty (judgement) upon conviction:


  Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.


Note that the Constitution limits the extent of the punishment, which gives leave for the Senate to ""sentence"" a person convicted to a punishment that is less extreme than removal and disqualification. 

Additional information: An comprehensive report was written by the Congressional Research Service on Impeachment and Removal in 2015. It can be found here

One of the more interesting takeaways in this report is:


  Impeachable conduct does not appear to be limited to criminal behavior.
  Congress has identified three general types of conduct that constitute grounds for
  impeachment, although these categories should not be understood as exhaustive:
  (1) improperly exceeding or abusing the powers of the office; (2) behavior
  incompatible with the function and purpose of the office; and (3) misusing the
  office for an improper purpose or for personal gain.

  Seeking to get legal clearance for the deportation plan, the home ministry told the Supreme Court this week it would confidentially provide it with intelligence information showing Rohingya links with Pakistan-based militants.  (source)
  
  “Our investigations have revealed that Al Qaeda wants to use India and Bangladesh as their base to start a religious war against Myanmar,” said New Delhi police official Pramod Singh Khuswah. “Clearly they are a threat to our security.” 


Other likely reasons


Demographics.

Rohingyas are majority Muslim. India has no desire to have more Muslims living there (it has enough friction with its own Muslim population and Muslim neighbors without adding the need for more). Bangladesh (which is majority Muslim) seems a better place from India's point of view

Additionally, Rohingyas are ethnically closer to Benghali than average Indian populace (though who and what they are seems to be rather convoluted mix). So, India gets to claim ""they are your people, they are your problem"" to Bangladesh.
Economics.

Housing and hosting a large # of refugees is a big economic drain - even more so when the refugees are not homogenuous with native populace (which removes local sources of bootstrapping for refugee individuals AND reduces overall trust capital of the area which reduces economy).

As such, if India has an option of ""we get to pay for hundreds of thousands of refugees, or we punt that on Bangladesh"", the preferred option for Indian government is kind of obvious.

",Reasonable,"The mathematical phenomenon you're talking about is Arrow's impossibility theorem. The wiki article has an informal proof.

Specifically, the theorem states that there's no way to design a voting system such that all three of these criteria hold:


  
  If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
  If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
  There is no ""dictator"": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.
  


(The theorem is stated in terms of a rank-order voting system. The winner-take-all and first-past-the-post systems are degenerate cases of this; each voter is asked only for their first preference, and the candidate who is the first preference of a majority or plurality of voters wins.)

Every democratic voting system fulfills the first and third criteria; therefore, they have to dispense with the second. This means that (for example) even if 60% of voters favor Candidate Alice over Candidate Bob, it's still possible for Bob to beat Alice. In a winner-take-all or first-past-the-post system, the way this would happen is through the introduction of a third candidate. If 30% of the voters now prefer Carl as their top choice, and all of those voters previously favored Alice over Bob, then Bob now has 40% of the vote while Alice and Carl each have 30%; Bob has beaten Alice. Voting systems such as instant-runoff voting can ameliorate this, but according to Arrow's impossibility theorem, they cannot entirely eliminate the possibility of a situation where Bob beats Alice even though a majority of the voters prefer Alice over Bob.

The most important practical implication of this is that a democratic voting system can't entirely eliminate the spoiler effect. More broadly, it means the possibility always exists that it's in a voter's interest to vote in a way that doesn't reflect their true preferences; in other words, tactical voting is always a factor in elections. Most people in democratic countries accept this as an unfortunate reality of the system.  Even so, some systems (such as winner-take-all) are more heavily impacted by tactical voting than others (such as instant-runoff).

""There's no one actively enforcing that rule, but in China, you have what are basically security guards on patrol of every residence to make sure they don't violate the government containment measures. That's a kind of approach I think can't be copied here in the United States.""


Likewise for suspending ""non-essential"" medical access:


  In China, elective surgeries and other non-critical doctors visits were delayed, and many medical services were moved online. [...]  But the move hasn't been without negative consequences. One man with kidney disease in China jumped to his death, Human Rights Watch reported. He couldn't get dialysis during the outbreak. Another boy with cerebral palsy died after being left alone for six days while his father was quarantined in China. 


A similar opinion was voiced in a Time interview:


  “No other nation (western or otherwise) can or should seek to replicate China’s actions,” Thomas Bollyky, the director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations, tells TIME via email. “The disregard for civil liberties and human rights that the government has demonstrated in its quarantine and censorship activities are inseparable from the policies and actions of the government that contributed to the outbreak in the first place.”


Other experts quoted earlier in a Science (news) piece were also skeptical that the full extent of China's measures could be copied in the West:


  The question now is whether the world can take lessons from China’s apparent success—and whether the massive lockdowns and electronic surveillance measures imposed by an authoritarian government would work in other countries. [...]
  
  “This report poses difficult questions for all countries currently considering their response to COVID-19,” says Steven Riley, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. “The joint mission was highly productive and gave a unique insight into China’s efforts to stem the virus from spread within mainland China and globally,” adds Lawrence Gostin, a global health law scholar at Georgetown University. But Gostin warns against applying the model elsewhere. “I think there are very good reasons for countries to hesitate using these kinds of extreme measures.”
  
  There’s also uncertainty about what the virus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, will do in China after the country inevitably lifts some of its strictest control measures and restarts its economy. COVID-19 cases may well increase again.


More recent cases from Hong Kong indicate that that fear of re-emergence may well be have been justified. So Hong Kong is back into lock down after it was largely lifted at the beginning of March.

Similar expert opinion on restrictions timing:


  Epidemiologists say China’s mammoth response had one glaring flaw: it started too late. In the initial weeks of the outbreak in December and January, Wuhan authorities were slow to report cases of the mysterious infection, which delayed measures to contain it, says Howard Markel, a public-health researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “The delay of China to act is probably responsible for this world event,” says Markel.
  
  A model simulation by Lai Shengjie and Andrew Tatem, emerging-disease researchers at the University of Southampton, UK, shows that if China had implemented its control measures a week earlier, it could have prevented 67% of all cases there. Implementing the measures 3 weeks earlier, from the beginning of January, would have cut the number of infections to 5% of the total. [...]
  
  But between 16 and 30 January, a period that included the first 7 days of the lockdown, the number of people each infected individual gave the virus to dropped to 1.05, estimates Adam Kucharski, who models infectious-disease spread at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That was amazing,” he says. [...]
  
  “These extreme limitations on population movement have been quite successful,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. [... However,] China is suppressing the virus, not eradicating it, says Osterholm. The world will need to wait until about eight weeks after China resumes to some form of normality to know what it did or didn’t accomplish with its population-movement limitations, he says.
  
  There is probably a fierce debate going on in China about when to relax the lockdown measures, says Roy Anderson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. He suggests there could be a second wave of new infections when they are lifted.


So whether it's possible to (fully) emulate China's response (in the West) depends not only on the political framework, but also to which experts the (Western) governments might be paying [most] attention to.

I realize this is a long answer already, but there was a recent interview with one of China's [own] CDC officials (whom seldom get interviewed in the West). Some interesting points from there:


  Q: What mistakes are other countries making?
  
  A: The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. [...]
  
  Q: People who tested positive in Wuhan but only had mild disease were sent into isolation in large facilities and were not allowed to have visits from family. Is this something other countries should consider?
  
  A: Infected people must be isolated. [...]
  
  Q: Spread in China has dwindled to a crawl, and the new confirmed cases are mainly people entering the country, correct?
  
  A: Yes. At the moment, we don’t have any local transmission, but the problem for China now is the imported cases. So many infected travelers are coming into China.




More recently (April 2) it has been reported by DW that Germany is considering a voluntary phone app similar to the (mandatory?) one[s] used in China:


  The most famous health app was developed by the tech giant Alibaba in conjunction with the Chinese authorities. Other companies have also developed similar software, however. It was possible to work swiftly because the Chinese state already has access regarding citizens' movements and programmers did not have to worry about data protection laws. [...]
  
  There are many who hope that Germany will soon be using such an app. The Health Ministry and researchers at the Robert Koch Institute are developing similar software. The idea is to introduce a non-compulsory app that will not be able to detect who met whom and where but will be able to identify if a phone user was in close contact with another infected user.
  
  The app will only really be able to function if 60 percent of the population uses it. In Germany, it won't be as easy as in Asia to reach such a percentage.
  
  Will Germans cooperate?
  
  Half of the respondents to a recent poll said they would not oppose an app to help warn users who had come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19. 


They don't link to the poll, but I guess in was a poll in Germany given that this was an article on DW.

There's now a BBC video discussing Chinese-inspired surveillance measures to combat the outbreak. This is of course somewhat subjective, but they only short-listed Singapore, Israel, Iran, Taiwan and Russia as being closest to China-style surveillance measures used to combat the epidemic, like using CCTV cameras and phone tracking.
",Reasonable,"No,

Article I Section 3 of the United States Constitution mandates the seats of the three class of Senators to be vacated at the expiration of the 2nd, 4th and 6th years respectively. Elections are to be held to choose one third of the Senators “every second year“.


  The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one third may be chosen every second year;


So, unless there are vacancies in the Senate (see special election procedure outlined in the 17th Amendment), elections for the three different classes of Senators are mandated by the Constitution to be held every two years.

8928,51220,Why was the World Health Organization against travel restrictions following the COVID-19 outbreak?,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization initially opposed countries instituting travel or trade restrictions.



Why did they oppose these policies at that time? Is there any evidence that non-medical considerations such as political pressure played a role in the World Health Organization's decision?
",51221,"Probably because prior WHO research was rather skeptical of their ultimate effectiveness:  


  Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.


That paper was co-authored (on behalf of the WHO) by employees of the [US] CDC (lead author actually), the ECDC, the UK's HPA, Australian DHA, and some of WHO's own employees. So you could say it was a fairly broad consensus at the time it was written (2006).

The WHO has actually explained/defended their reasoning in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in more detail in a February press release:


  WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.
  
  In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. Furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.
  
  Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. Such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.
  
  Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact. Since WHO declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in relation to COVID-19, and as of 27 February, 38 countries have reported to WHO additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic in relation to travel to and from China or other countries, ranging from denial of entry of passengers, visa restrictions or quarantine for returning travellers. Several countries that denied entry of travellers or who have suspended the flights to and from China or other affected countries, are now reporting cases of COVID-19.
  
  Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. [...]


I haven't found more recent press releases on this matter, especially after the US and the EU have imposed much more wider travel bans. I do wonder the extent to which the WHO might have reconsidered that initial approach...

Aside, comment on the question... I wonder why you found it necessary to use ""that guy from India"" as the motivator for this question when (in the US) a poll published on March 26 says...


  In thinking about specific steps that have been announced to address the coronavirus outbreak, majorities of Republicans and Democrats view a range of measures as necessary to stem the spread of the virus. For example, overwhelming majorities of both Republicans (96%) and Democrats (94%) say restricting international travel to the U.S. is necessary.

",Reasonable,"It establishes a pattern. If someone is many years in arrears of paying their taxes, they are likely to continue to do so, both from the standpoint that they haven't been punished for it, and from the standpoint of not suddenly calling attention to one's self. By wiping the slate clean of taxes you are unlikely to be able to collect anyway, you get people on the record and in the system, both to help start a new habit (of paying taxes) and getting a better idea of what they should be paying the next year.

8930,51231,What is the current paid leave system in the United States given the COVID-19 outbreak?,"The US has enacted law H.R.6201 - Families First Coronavirus Response Act which seems to mainly tackle elementary/secondary students' food availability, but also expanded FMLA among other things. I've seen various posts on Facebook that are, at best, outdated or, at worst, straight-up false. Some of the posts I've seen state that the US is requiring 2-week paid leave. But the summary of the law makes it sound like that falls to the state's unemployment program. When reading the actual text of the law regarding paid leave, it states that the first 10 days are unpaid; any leave after that is paid. So what does paid leave look like then?

For example, my place of business is shutting down next week, March 30th, and maybe subsequent weeks. I'm told that I can use PTO (of which I have none) or draw unemployment. Assuming that COVID-19 cases skyrocket in my county and we shutdown for more than 10 days, do I start getting paid on Day 11?

To further muddy the water, there is an exemption for businesses with fewer than 50 employees. I think this replaces the previous exemption of businesses with more than 500 employees. 

If the above is correct, let's say my factory (in Kansas) has 150 employees, but is owned by a company (national, but headquartered in Michigan) with >>500 employees. The company is a subsidiary of a larger, international corporation (I have no idea how many are employed under the corporation). 

Do I still qualify for paid leave on Day 1? Day 11? Not at all (this is America; bootstraps etc)? 

Assume that I am a healthy, essential employee with no children. Why we're still shutting down despite being deemed essential is beyond me.
",51232,"The Department of Labor has a nifty Q&amp;A page (Questions 2 and 3 in particular). In short, private sector corporations are considered as a single employer and thus count each employee within the company. If the employee count is greater than 500 the corporation in question is exempt from paid leave due to COVID-19

For what kind of coverage a smaller company can expect, this fact sheet also provided by DoL states that:


  Generally, the Act provides that employees of covered employers are eligible for:
  
  
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at the employee’s regular rate of pay where the employee is unable to work because the employee is quarantined (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), and/or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis; or
  Two weeks (up to 80 hours) of paid sick leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay because the employee is unable to work because of a bona fide need to care for an individual subject to quarantine (pursuant to Federal, State, or local government order or advice of a health care provider), or to care for a child (under 18 years of age) whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19, and/or the employee is experiencing a substantially similar condition as specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Treasury and Labor; and
  Up to an additional 10 weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the employee’s regular rate of pay where an employee, who has been employed for at least 30 calendar days, is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19.
  


To summarize, paid leave applies if the private sector employee shows symptoms of COVID-19, is told to self-quarantine by health care provider, is quarantined by federal/state/local order, or if employee is taking care of a family member that qualifies for one of the above reasons or if employee's child(ren) is stuck at home due to school/daycare closures related to COVID-19.

Federal employees are still covered by Title II of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was not amended by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
",Reasonable,"A few personal thoughts on this topic.


Turkish army has to go through the Kurds' lands. That seems impossible without fighting against Kurds first. And that would be both troublesome and frown upon by USA.
Turkey has no national interest in fighting against ISIS. They are not a threat for Turkey for a moment. Only media make people think of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Politicians do think of ""allies"" and ""enemies"".
Today Syria appears to be a total chaos; bellum omnia contra omnes. If Turkish army invaded Syria on its own (no alliance), then in a few weeks they would fight against all sides, just as it's happening now: ISIS against SAR, ISIS against An-Nusra, An-Nusra against FSA, FSA against SAR and so on. That's simply not an option. Yet making any alliance without prior approving by ""the friends from NATO"" is too much even for Turkey.


Thus we have what we have now: a new normal ""hybrid"" war with Turkey (along with USA, Saudis etc.) supporting their sort of ""green men"" and ""rebels"", but not going straight into the battle.

8931,51246,"If the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies, what happens?","With the news that Boris Johnson has tested positive for COVID-19, and was later hospitalised, a question occurred to me: 

What happens if the UK Prime Minister suddenly dies?  

I know that the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the party with the most seats, and presumably the party would somehow choose a new leader as soon as they can.  However, organizing a vote of the Conservative part membership would still require at least a few days under normal circumstances;  and under the current circumstances, it might take significantly longer.  

Is there simply no Prime Minister until the governing party can choose another one?  If so, how are the functions of the head of government performed during this time?

I'd be interested in knowing how this would work (if it's any different) in other Westminster systems as well.  I saw the question on What happens if the UK Prime Minister resigns?, but the answer there assumes a orderly transition period during which the incumbent continues to serve while a new party leader is chosen.  
",51247,"Your understanding is correct - there is no UK Prime Minister until one is appointed by the Queen. In the meantime, the Civil Contingencies Act (2004) gives the Monarch (in practice, government ministers) powers to make emergency regulations, and COBRA meetings can be chaired by any Cabinet minister - after 9/11, these were chaired by the Cabinet Secretary until the PM could attend himself.

The Queen will appoint as PM the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the person chosen as the leader of the party with the most MPs - in this case, the party that the deceased PM previously led. How this is chosen, and how quickly, will depend on the party in question, although in these circumstances it seems likely that an interim leader would be speedily chosen. The Labour Party's rules for this are described in Steve Melnikoff's answer here. In the case of the Conservative Party, their constitution states under Schedule 2 - Rules for the Election of the Leader that:


  
  Upon the initiation of an election for the Leader, it shall be the
  duty of the 1922 Committee to present to the Party, as soon as
  reasonably practicable, a choice of candidates for election as Leader.
  The rules for deciding the procedure by which the 1922 Committee
  selects candidates for submission for election shall be determined by
  the Executive Committee of the 1922 Committee after consultation of
  the Board. 
  If there is only one candidate at the time laid down for
  the close of nominations, that candidate shall be declared Leader of
  the Party.
  


It would be possible, then, for MPs to be strongly encouraged to only nominate one candidate in order to conclude this process as quickly as possible, without a full membership vote. You may remember in 2016, for example, Andrea Leadson withdrew from the leadership contest leaving Theresa May as the sole candidate, which meant that there was no ballot of the party membership.

In the specific case you raise, however, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was given the role of 'Designated Survivor' on March 22nd, and will carry out Johnson's duties that he can't perform himself while he is affected by the virus. It should be noted that this role is not an official post, and if Johnson were to die from the virus then it is not a given that Raab would be appointed leader of the party and therefore the new PM. In fact, the article notes that this designation was challenged by some in the Cabinet, who thought that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, should have been given the role, and  indeed; Gove replaced Johnson at the daily press briefing on March 27th. Another contender might be Jeremy Hunt, against whom Johnson won the Conservative  Party leadership election in 2019.

As for other Westminster systems, there is no blanket answer to that question. It is perfectly possible for a bill to be introduced that immediately designates the new Prime Minister on their death, as in the US system. Indeed, in 2013, Peter Bone MP introduced the Prime Minister (Replacement) Bill, which contains the following provision:


  In the event of the death or incapacitation of a person holding the
  title of Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, the title,
  salary and functions of that role shall be conferred upon another
  Secretary or Minister of State in accordance with the following order
  of precedence— 
  
  
  (a) person bearing the designation of Deputy Prime
  Minister; 
  (b) Secretary of State with responsibility for Home Affairs;
  (c) Secretary of State with responsibility for Defence;
  ...
  


This bill did not make it onto the statute books, but it proves the point that it is possible for an order of succession to exist in a Westminster system.
",Reasonable,"TL;DR Yes, see ""primitive communism"".

There is no NPOV answer to your questions, it all depends on your definitions and judgment of evidence. My answer is an attempt to explain things according to the point of view of Marx &amp; Engels.

Full disclosure: I consider myself a communist.

According to Marx, the answer to the question is Yes.

To be communist, a society MUST be non-dictatorial - as dictatorship necessarily requires a state to control the means of production. If you do not have a means of coercion to control the means of production (army, police, etc.) - then you do not have a state.


  ""When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of
  a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its
  political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely
  the organized power of one class for oppressing another. If the
  proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by
  the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class; if, by
  means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such,
  sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will,
  along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the
  existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will
  thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class. In place of the
  old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we
  shall have an association in which the free development of each is the
  condition for the free development of all."", Communist Manifesto,
  Chapter 2


Therefore it is a logical impossibility that there should be communist society that is dictatorial. Rather, the question is then: Has there ever been a communist society? If there has not been, then the answer to your question is No, otherwise Yes.

Communist societies have existed before the state ever existed, in the form that Marx refers to as ""primitive communism""

Adding to the requirement of a stateless and classless society - in order to have communism, you must also abolish value itself. In Marxist theory, value is not the same as prince, and value is not the same as exchange value or use value. In Marx terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. A commodity is any good or service produced by human labor and offered as a product for general sale on the market. To abolish value, you must abolish commodities and therefore markets.

@DVK is mostly incorrect, but @jvm is incorrect in other aspects too:

@jvm: Marx was certainly a Marxist, but said he was not as a way of saying, ""if this is Marxism, then I'm not a Marxist"" against the French communists &amp; Paul Lafargue. Discussion on: I'm not a Marxist

Now to the few examples pointed out: Early christian communites, Kibbutzim, early workers' soviets (= councils) in Russia, The Paris Commune, Anarchism during the spanish civil war, particularly around Barcelona.

In none of these examples can we reasonably expect that the market or state was abolished as these societies either operated within a bigger picture where it was not abolished. In early Soviet Russia just after the revolution the market was certainly not dissolved. The Paris Commune was attacked and had armed forces. If you trade with places where the market still exists then commodities still exist. Anarchism during the Spanish Civil War was during a civil war - therefore they were fighting to uphold a means of production - therefore not communism.

The claim that @DVK makes that communism would somehow be an impossibility due to genes and how we evolved, i.e: ""greed is in human nature"" would require some scientific claims in the field of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. When it comes to biology, we are as genetically close to the violent chimpanzees as to the sharing bonobos that are the only other species except for us that uses sex for pleasure. One thing is for certain: cooperation is what made us the #1 apex predator species of the world. One human vs. one tiger is one well fed tiger. A few humans with tools against a tiger is a dead tiger.

One needs to remember that Capitalism had centuries to mature into the state it is in now - it had bloody revolutions, dictatorships, etc. One can't expect that the communist movement needs to honor ""three strikes &amp; you are out"".

8932,51258,Have any countries or regions announced coronavirus control plans other than quarantine/contact tracing?,"So far the Western nations I'm aware of seem to be trending towards the Chinese/South Korean plan for coronavirus containment:


Lockdown the entire country until the number of new cases is manageable
Introduce localized quarantines and contact tracing to minimize the number of new infections
Wait for the vaccine or cure


However point #3 is risky, as no one is sure if a vaccine can be at all created or if an effective enough cure can be developed. Therefore it might be tempting for some countries to go for an alternative approach in an attempt to balance the risks. Have any countries officially (or at least indirectly) announced such a plan? Some alternative solutions I'm aware of:


""Do nothing"" 
Isolating the elderly, but no general quarantine
Chickenpox style variolation, similar to the pox parties of the past
Maintaining a full lockdown from the world without having the virus locally - 22 countries report this so far


I am aware that the situation is currently evolving around the world, so I expect new answers to trickle in within the next months. 
",52280,"If depends quite a bit what you mean by ""plans other than quarantine"". There are of course efforts to test anti-virals and develop a vaccine. But the amount antivirals available might not suffice in the short run, even if they prove [safe and] effective.

Generally speaking however


  Given the lack of testing in Europe and the US, the only way to keep the sick and healthy apart is to keep everyone apart. And that produces a recession.


And the alternative for that would be to test everyone. It's been done at small scale (you'll be amused where) in Italy, in the very first region hit, i.e. in the town of Vò. But the trouble is that testing capacity doesn't quite scale to the ""test everyone in the country"" presently... except maybe in Iceland, the only country I know of that that is doing random testing on a serious scale (relative to the country's size); but it's worth noting that there's convergence between random testing and the chunk of the population that gets tested in Iceland:


  Iceland has tested a far greater proportion of its population than anywhere else on earth, including South Korea — another country touted for its effective response to the pandemic.
  
  But what makes Iceland unique is that test samples are not only taken from ‘high risk’ individuals who have exhibited symptoms, came into contact with known carriers, or returned from countries such as China and Italy, they are also offered to thousands of ordinary members of its general population, who are nonsymptomatic.


On should not discount the level of quarantines imposed in Iceland either though:


  Across this remote and rugged island nation of a little more than 364,000, as of Friday morning there were almost 10,000 men, women and children — equivalent to 9 million Americans — under this form of state-enforced lock and key.


So it's more like ""more of everything"" being done over there rather than ""alternative plans"".



If by plans you mean plans to relax the lockdowns at some point, every country is probably thinking/considering when they can do that. Economists have been spurred into providing answers to hard-choice questions that need to balance economic damage/recession with the lives saved (in the short run). See e.g.


""Managing economic lockdowns in an epidemic"", or in more depth
""The Macroeconomics of Epidemics"" (Eichenbaum et al.); also covered in (the latter half of a) NYT article.


Alas the experience of Hong Kong last week shows that lockdowns may [need to] return in some cases/areas...



I somehow missed the ""odd man out"", in this case, Bolsonaro:


  In a televised address last week, he repeated a now well-worn phrase. ""It's just a little flu or the sniffles,"" he said, blaming the media once again for the hysteria and panic over Covid-19.
  
  A few days later, he clearly demonstrated his prioritisation of the economy over isolation measures favoured by the rest of the world.
  
  ""People are going to die, I'm sorry,"" he said. ""But we can't stop a car factory because there are traffic accidents.""
  
  ""Jair Bolsonaro is alone right now,"" says Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of the publication Americas Quarterly. ""No other major world leader is denying the severity of this to the extent [...]
  
  A few days ago, a video was shared by Jair Bolsonaro's son, Flavio - a politician himself.
  
  The video's message, which claimed to come from the Brazilian government, was that ""BRAZIL CAN'T STOP"" (in Portuguese, #obrasilnãopodeparar). People need to keep working to keep the country safe and the economy growing.
  
  So much so, in fact, that a federal judge on Saturday banned the government from campaigning against isolation measures. Government posts on social media using the hashtag were hastily removed.
  
  ""He's clearly laying the foundation of being able to say six months to a year from now that he did not agree with tough distancing measures, with the lockdown,"" says Oliver Stuenkel, Associate Professor of International Relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo.


That kind of internal power struggle has happened to some extent in Pakistan too, although the military apparently gained the upper hand and managed to impose some level of lockdowns despite opposition from some politicians and clerics. And Khan (like Bolsonaro) also seems to hedge his bets:


  Prime Minister Imran Khan, however, has appeared out of step with local provincial governments. He had previously said a ""lockdown"" would not be sustainable in Pakistan, as it would cause too much harm to those on low incomes.
  
  After provincial governments went ahead and introduced measures tantamount to a ""lockdown"" anyway, Mr Khan attempted to explain he only opposed what he described as a ""curfew,"" while also outlining some measures to protect the poorest in society, who are dependent on daily wages to feed their families. Unlike other Muslim countries, his government has not ordered an end to congregational prayers on Fridays.

",Reasonable,"Judging by the plenary agenda link that Joe C provided, it seems they're booked next week from Monday to Thursday, and then have nothing planned until the Nov 13th.

At the very least there's a factual error in there. It should read the 13th rather than the 14th.

Further, the MEPs could arguably sit at some point by the end of the month to get this passed -- and I'd wager will, if British MPs pass Johnson's bill.

That said, even if British MPs do pass the bill, I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if MEPs end up looking into the text several days later. Insofar as their reputation goes and insofar as I've seen from watching anecdotal debates, MEPs tend to come very well prepared to debates. Given this, I'd suggest they'd be rather unimpressed with a third party sticking a gun to their faces and trying to get them to vote under pressure. So much so, in fact, that  I could totally imagine Verhofstadt pushing to get some kind of language in the coming extension so that, if they're not done deciding themselves, it kicks in even if British MPs end up passing Johnson's deal at the last minute.

On the flip side, you can safely bet that MEPs as a group are well prepared for the coming bill already, and continuing to prepare. This has a long history in fact. Barnier has been explaining what his team has been doing every single week since the whole thing began, and their negotiation strategy was out in the open for everyone to read. As such, and in stark contrast with British MPs, who had no idea of what was going on or of what was heading their way until the last minute agreement was passed, with only a few days to go through the thing and conduct an analysis of whether they like it, MEP aides who were following the topic had, if not the word for word legalese, at least a fairly good idea of what was heading their way already.

He also suggested in a prior article that the EU would accept an extension if asked, and apparently Johnson will send a letter to that effect tonight.

8933,51260,"Are there any surveys in the US on whether ""preserving the American way"" is worth the risk of sacrificing their elderly to COVID-19?","CNBC reported that:


  [Dan] Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, said Monday on Fox News, “As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that is the exchange, I’m all in.”


Apparently on the same show another fairly high profile US politician said


  SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): For a small segment of our population, it's true, the coronavirus can kill you. For a small segment.
  
  But you know what else can kill you? Poverty. Hunger. Losing the entire economy.
  
  And we need to stop thinking about the next election and try to think a little more about the next generation and what we leave to them, which is going to be the little end of nothing if we let this economy collapse.


According to CNN (which alas doesn't link to the actual polls they mention):


  The often-dismissive messaging from Fox News hosts was notable, given that the viewers who make up the network's audience skew older and are thus more vulnerable to the disease.
  
  Polls from both Gallup and Pew Research revealed that Republicans — who are largely distrustful of mainstream news organizations and primarily turn to Fox News and other right-wing sources for information on current events — were much less likely to take the risks of the coronavirus as seriously as their Democratic counterparts.


Of course, this being a rather emotionally charged judgement, it probably matters a lot how one phrases such a question/choice. Still, I want to know if there any surveys in the US on how much the public sees the mortality risk posed by COVID-19 (which as we know is most elevated for the elderly) as acceptable in balance with preserving the ""American way of life"", ""keeping America great"", or some other equivalently formulated socioeconomic normality [for the US]?



Before I get anymore downvotes, please note that I'm not endorsing those views... but they do exist in various shapes, e.g.


  As fears of COVID-19 spread, so too have ageist messages suggesting that the coronavirus is a disease of the old, with internet memes referring to the virus as a ‘boomer remover.’ 


On the less frivolous side, the NYT has an article [sub]titled: ""Shutdown Spotlights Economic Cost of Saving Lives. President Trump and others have asked if halting normal life and commerce to fight the coronavirus is worth the cost. Here’s how economists figure it. [...]


  “Economists should be doing this cost-benefit analysis,” said Walter Scheidel, an economic historian at Stanford University. “Why is nobody putting some numbers on the economic costs of a monthlong or a yearlong shutdown against the lives saved? The whole discipline is well equipped for it. But there is some reluctance for people to stick their neck out.”


(For more on economics aspects of the crisis, see this econ SE question.)

So I think I'm well justified in asking this question, i.e. how widespread such views might be, especially when it comes to making a [hard] choice.
",51262,"In the most recent polls I found (and there are a helluva lot of polls on coronavirus in the US) from March 26:


  About seven-in-ten adults (71%) say that to address the coronavirus, it is necessary to require most businesses other than grocery stores or pharmacies to close. A larger share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (81%) than Republicans and GOP leaners (61%) view this requirement as necessary.


So most are (now) approving of not-business-as-usual measures to combat the epidemic. Actually, a bit later, this Pew poll details the public response to a few more specific measures, although this is aftery had been anounced/implemented:



As some [polling] pundits predicted a week ago after commenting on those old-by-now polls (of March 20 or so):


  Pew shows that 59% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say the ""outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole,"" while only 33% of Republicans and Republican leaners agree.
  
  It is certainly possible that this significant partisan gap in views of the coronavirus situation will narrow in the weeks ahead. Partisans take cues from the statements of their leaders, and Trump and other Republican politicians initially were publicly skeptical of the significance of the virus, in some instances claiming that it reflected a partisan effort by Democrats and ""the media"" to criticize Trump. Now, Trump and his allies have begun to move away from that previous posture and are at the forefront of proclaiming the seriousness of the crisis. As media observers have noted, this in turn has brought about shifts in the tone of the coverage by Fox News, and these shifts may narrow the partisanship gap in the days and weeks to come if rank-and-file Republicans follow the cues given by their favored thought leaders.

",Reasonable,"EU membership is based on treaties so in principle the successor state would still be a member (and France certainly remained a member of the EC after the independence of Algeria…). Any other state would need to be admitted to the EU if not through the regular accession procedure, at least through some ad hoc agreement with all current members.

But in reality, such a break-up would be such a momentous event that it would certainly be handled at highest level, in the European Council, on a case-by-case basis. And if all members agree, it's always possible to find some sort of solution, if needed by amending the treaties or creating new ones (cf. everything that has been done during the ongoing Euro crisis). The rest does not matter all that much.

And therein lies the rub: Some current members, first and foremost Spain, are very hostile to giving EU membership for breakaway regions, for fear of bolstering similar movements in their own country. Case in point, Mariano Rajoy, Spain's current prime minister repeatedly stated publicly that Spain would not allow Scotland to remain in the union in case it became independent and did it again last week. That means that even the regular route to membership could be closed in such a scenario (current members can basically veto a candidacy indefinitely, like Greece and Bulgaria are doing to Macedonia over the name of the country).

or 


  Trump's pro-economy death-permissive stance during the COVID-19 crisis


What are the facts backing this claim?
",52277,"I can't speak for Rebecca's judgement in interpreting those words of Trump, but for instance a NYT article says:


  “Our people want to return to work,” Mr. Trump declared Tuesday on Twitter, adding, “THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM!”
  
  In essence, he was raising an issue that economists have long grappled with: How can a society assess the trade-off between economic well-being and health? [...]
  
  “We put a lot of weight on saving lives,” said Casey Mulligan, a University of Chicago economist who spent a year as chief economist on Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. “But it’s not the only consideration. That’s why we don’t shut down the economy every flu season. They’re ignoring the costs of what they’re doing. They also have very little clue how many lives they’re saving.” [...]
  
  “Making people poorer has health consequences as well,” said Kip Viscusi, an economist at Vanderbilt University who has spent his career using economic techniques to assess the costs and benefits of government regulations.
  
  Jobless people sometimes commit suicide. The poor are likelier to die if they get sick. Mr. Viscusi estimates that across the population, every loss of income of $100 million in the economy causes one additional death.
  
  Government agencies calculate these trade-offs regularly. The Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has established a cost of about $9.5 million per life saved as a benchmark for determining whether to clean up a toxic waste site.
  
  Other agencies use similar values to assess whether to invest in reducing accidents at an intersection or to tighten safety standards in a workplace. The Department of Agriculture has a calculator to estimate the economic costs — medical care, premature deaths, productivity loss from nonfatal cases — of food-borne disease.


So, the argument [in there] is that governments always make such trade-offs/choices, whether they are incredibly open about them or less so.



I should also mention (here, in case comments get purged again) that the NYT article discusses in a bit more depth the finer points of balancing the economic losses from lockdowns with those that would occur in an unchecked epidemic. This topic has been a addressed in some recent economics publications, e.g. Eichenbaum et al. discussed in the NYT article; but see also a simpler ""lockdowns 101 economics"".

SCOTUS refused to hear a case involving the Nevada election ballot. The ballot contains an option for ""None of the Above."" In 1998, Harry Reid won re-election over then Republican Rep. John Ensign by 428 votes while more than 8,000 voters rejected both men and opted for ""none."" Clearly this unique ballot affected the race, and the nation (Reid is the Senate Majority Leader today).

EDIT: Pursuant to the comment below:
The 15th amendment says that the right to vote cannot be denied due to race. The 19th amendment gave woman the right to vote. The 24th amendment prohibits poll taxes. And the 26th amendment gives 18 years old the right to vote. Any election law must be compliant with these amendments.
As for the SCOTUS case: At the district court level, the court ruled the option to be unconstitutional; however, at the appeal level, the judge threw out the lawsuit and issued an emergency stay which allowed the option to stay on the ballot. I have not found any resource that explains the Supreme Courts decision not to hear the case.
 Some background about the case: The Republican National Committee (RNC) challenged the law because if ""None of these Candidates"" received the majority of votes, it could not win the election and hold office. The Nevada Attorney General counter argued that the option was a form of protest and a offered the same outcome as someone who did not vote.

",52289,"Trump has never had better ratings - but that's not the whole story.

This analysis from the CBC shows a fuller picture.


  Donald Trump has the highest approval ratings since the first few weeks of his presidency.


a 47% approval rating

However he has also had the lowest approval ratings of any president on average, never once having had an approval rate of more than 50%, and averaging around 43%. The last few weeks is the first time since March 2017 his approval has been higher than his disapproval.

Also all leaders have been polling better in this crisis, and most have been polling much higher than Trump . In a Fox News poll:


  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health; local officials got 75 per cent; state governments 74 per cent; Vice-President Mike Pence 55 per cent; and Trump 51 per cent.
  
  The federal and provincial governments in Canada are getting high marks for their handling of the crisis, with approval ratings mainly in the 60s...France's unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, has gotten a bounce, with polls showing him gaining as much as 14 per cent during the crisis. Italy's governing party is polling better, too.


A high approval in a crisis does not mean re-election.


  Take George H.W. Bush, who had an approval rating around 90 per cent after winning the first Gulf War in 1991 but lost re-election the following year. A soft economy quickly pulled his Gallup approval down as low as 29 per cent.

8985,52306,Has the WHO said anything about travel restrictions since the end of February?,"The WHO was against travel restrictions as they detailed in a press release at the end of February. But in the month past (March) practically every country on earth has instituted travel restrictions, most recently China, which is now afraid of being reinfected from abroad.

So, has the WHO changed their public stance in any way about travel restrictions by now? I searched a bit, but it seems they've gone mum on the topic of travel, while (of course) strongly advocating for social distancing in general. (Aside: the WHO wants us to use ""physical distancing"" as the more appropriate term for that.)

I haven't done anything like a survey on this, but clearly some governments include ""minimize travel"" in the physical distantincing advice they give, e.g. Australia's 


  Government advice for implementing physical distancing has mainly urged people to isolate themselves in space: staying at least 1.5 metres apart, working from home, avoiding gatherings, and minimising travel.


So maybe the WHO has done the same somewhere in their recommendations and I've missed it.

Likewise, there have been at least three (high-profile) publications in Science this month on this:


March 6


  the travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in Mainland China, but has a more marked effect at the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80% until mid February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.

March 25


  It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

March 31


  The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29). [...] This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities, which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical regression model. [It also analyzes, and finds effective (via association), most city-level social-distancing measures:] Our model suggests that, without the Wuhan travel ban or the national emergency response, there would have been 744,000 (± 156,000) confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan by 19 February, day 50 of the epidemic. With the Wuhan travel ban alone, this number would have decreased to 202,000 (± 10,000) cases. With the national emergency response alone (without the Wuhan travel ban), the number of cases would have decreased to 199,000 (± 8500). Thus, neither of these interventions would, on their own, have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February. But together and interactively, these control measures offer an explanation of why the rise in incidence was halted and reversed, limiting the number of confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 ± 1400 cases), 96% fewer than expected in the absence of interventions.



So maybe there's a ""wind of change"" in the scientific community on this, maybe not, but perhaps it's too early to tell what the consensus might become on this. So I'm ""holding off"" on accepting the answer below for now (based on a non-mention in a March 11 WHO statement) as rather inconclusive.
",52307,"The WHO released a joined statement with the ICAO ([on the WHO website it's dated 11 March 2020). It does not mention travel restrictions directly. It does, however, stress cooperation at different levels, for example between ""aviation and health authorities"". 

My interpretation is that the WHO is leaving such restrictions up to the states, at least in their public statements. 
",Reasonable,"Donald Trump tweeted the following on August 27, 2017:


  With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.

  ""This determination is not part of a Mexican negotiating strategy, but a principle of national sovereignty and dignity,"" the statement said.


The same article also discusses Trump's suggestion that the US withdraw from NAFTA and Mexico's response:


  Mexico said its position at the negotiating table was ""serious and constructive"" and sought a winning result for Mexico, the US and Canada.
  
  ""Mexico will not negotiate NAFTA nor any other aspect of the bilateral relationship through social media or the media,"" the ministry added.


More recently (December 19, 2018), Trump has claimed that Mexico would be paying for the wall via a new trade treaty:


  Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!


However, both NPR and PolitiFact fact-checked this claim and found it unsupported by the available evidence.  I wasn't able to find an official Mexican response to Trump's tweet, but I imagine they would prefer not to reopen negotiations and are deliberately ignoring the President, in keeping with their previous comments quoted above.

Basically every country world-wide has now implemented such measures. 

Reports from outside the first-world, however, make it seem like this is a much more challenging policy to implement. Police in South Africa are firing rubber bullets at shoppers who are violating lockdown and in India there are literally millions on the march home despite the country's lockdown order. Staying at home and keeping distance is impossible in slums with huts and no running water. Furthermore, poor people also much less able to survive a period without income and poorer countries are less able to provide them with support during this period.

Is there good evidence whether or not current lockdown/social distancing measures are sustainable in poorer third-world countries? If not, are there any other options for such countries to fight global pandemic that can be sustained and enforced?  
",52343,"In many ""poorer non-first world countries"" it's going to be very challenging. People often need to work every day in order to ""eat"" the next day, which prohibits social distancing measures. They have a problem with the availability of sanitation - for hand cleaning. The density of the population in some of these countries is also very significant, which can provide an additional risk factor for a greater spread of the virus.

From past epidemics for example in sub-Saharan Africa, they needed a lot of mostly international humanitarian help. Medical systems in poor countries usually have little capacity to deal with a huge number of cases. They also don't have a way for effective testing for the virus, laboratories... The question is to what extent can humanitarian help be made available.  

""Rich countries"" and international organizations providing governance, medicine, and other resources are currently in the core of epidemics themselves. This crisis is also economically challenging, which adds prohibitive cost to invest in humanitarian help for poorer countries. IMF is currently planning to lend around $1trn to developing countries, and hopefully, G20 will also provide at least some humanitarian capacity to help them. From a political point of perspective, China can use this as an opportunity to extend its influence over developing economies requiring help with fighting Covid virus.

Prohibitive measures could also be used by some of the political regimes to tighten their grip on power which could lead to destabilization.

On the other hand for example in India, you have a huge pharmaceutical sector which makes medicine, which can help in providing antibiotics or other types of medicine which could be beneficial for sick people.

The virus could also be weakened by a warm climate, which is not yet scientifically proven. Population structure in poor countries is usually much younger, which is another benefit, although people can be malnourished and have different medical problems which could make things worse if they were to become infected by Coronavirus.

",Reasonable,"The 3% deficit floor and the 60% Debt-to-GDP ratio were part of the Euro convergence criteria of the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht Treaty).

The framework is developed in Article 104c, with the specifics left to the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.

As to where these limits came from, Luigi L. Pasinetti states in The myth (or folly) of the 3% deficit/GDP Maastricht ‘parameter’:


  Nobody has ever been able to give any plausible explanation of why
  these two figures were chosen.  As  far  as  the  60%  ratio  is 
  concerned,  the  most  likely  inference  is  that  it  amounted  to
  roughly  the    average  observed    in  Europe  at  the  time  of 
  the  drawing  up  of  the  Treaty,  with  both Germany and France
  being near it. But other countries (notably Belgium and Italy) were
  far from it; and since it would have been unreasonable (in fact
  impossible) to require immediate adjustment, a proviso  was added
  (art.104c) stating that a higher Debt/GDP ratio than the “reference”
  one would be acceptable if  “the ratio is sufficiently
  diminishing”.
  
  More  difficult  to  explain  is  the  choice  of  the 
  3%  public  Deficit/GDP  “reference  value”, especially  if  one 
  considers  that,  on  this  point,  the  Treaty  is  now  being 
  interpreted  very  strictly, allowing for absolutely no deviation (not
  even by any small fraction of a percentage point) from the 3% figure.
  Such a rigid stance is so extraordinary as to lead one to think that
  any justification can only be found in the realm of symbolism. The
  whole of the Maastricht Treaty seems to have been reduced to the
  fulfilment of this symbolic figure of a 3% public Deficit/GDP ratio
  stated in one of its  Annexes.  But  even  symbols  cannot  escape 
  the  reality  of  their  implications.  If  a  3%  public Deficit/GDP 
  ratio  is  to  be  rigidly  adhered  to  and  regarded  as  a  symbol 
  of    European  fiscal  and financial stability (even at the cost of
  heavy sacrifices), it surely should be an absolutely necessary
  condition for fiscal and financial stability.

  Airports in Luzon [large island in Philippines where the capital, Manila, is located] will stop all outbound international flights starting Friday after the government gave a 72-hour window to all those who wish to leave the country after heightened measures were put in place to control the spread of COVID-19.

Namibia: ""suspending inbound and outbound flights from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany for 30 days""
Bolivia: ""cessation of all flights to and from Europe""
Peru: ""The measure means all international flights will be canceled. ""


I understand the ban of inbound international flights to prevent contaminated individuals from entering the country, but banning outbound flights seems less obvious to me.
",52326,"Another possibility, ignoring fears of infection, is that the country doesn't want their citizens to become stranded in another country if flights are suspended at a later date. For example, on Monday, March 30th, the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a £75m plan to charter flights to repatriate stranded Britons, and also advised any citizens still in countries where commercial flights remain available to fly home as soon as possible.

If a country's citizens become stranded abroad it will usually end up being the government's responsibility to fly them home.
",Reasonable,"As you rightly mentioned in your question, arguments in favour of majority government is that they tend to last much longer, bringing with it an element of stability. Whether you support the party in power or not, a majority government brings with it a clear sense of what to expect for a particular mandate period. In the Canadian political system, some argue that majorities are not healthy because it lacks a system of checks and balances (like the US system) and gives the prime minister and his or her government virtually the power to do almost anything they want throughout their time in office. A united opposition would be unable to prevent government measures from passing. Good if you support the governing party; not so good if your political views or priorities are not aligned with the government. 

Minority governments are interesting because they compel the governing party (which is usually the party with a plurality of seats in the House of Commons) to find common ground with one or more opposition parties. This forces upon elected officials to communicate and collaborate on the issues and to pass laws which, ideally, would benefit a larger swath of the population. 

The downside to minority governments are many; however. First of all, with a shelf life averaging just over 2 years, there is a cost to the taxpayer in terms of the frequency of general elections. For example, since 2001, Canada has seen elections in 2004 (Martin minority), 2006 (Harper minority), 2008 (Harper minority), 2011 (Harper majority) and 2015 (Trudeau majority). Each election comes with a $375-million price-tag, with the 2015 election roughly double that amount as it was the longest election period in Canadian history. 

The other downside is that minority governments often get defeated trying to accomplish the very things they set out to do in the electoral platform. Electing a minority government doesn't give the public a sense of predictability about what the government may do, because they require support from the opposition who come with their own demands. Political platforms are essentially invalid with a minority government either because they don't have the support to fulfill those promises, no time to complete them (being defeated before passing anything they've promised) or fulfilling part of their promises with some alterations proposed by opposition parties.  

Another element to minority governments in recent Canadian elections is the changing of political party leaders. The Liberals have gone through 6 party leaders since 2006 (including interim leaders); The Progressive Conservatives went through this kind of phase after the Joe Clark government was defeated, and again when the Reform Party was established. When you combine party leadership ballots and the volatility of minority governments, it can really give someone the sense of a continuous, never-ending election cycle. 

Which is better? It really all depends on what you value in our political system. Do you want collaboration over certainty? Do you want predictability or the power to remove an incompetent government?

",52367,"Looking on the FDA website, I found this: 

Notice of Declaration under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for medical countermeasures against COVID-19

In brief, it lays out that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is offering limited immunity from lawsuits and prosecution — at his considered discretion — for medicines and equipment to be used against the Covid-19 pandemic. It allows approved equipment and medicines to be used in 'off-label' or unapproved ways, and allows drugs that are being researched under 'investigative' exemptions, or even drugs or products that the Secretary decides could reasonably be on the market within 10 years (meaning drugs that are early in development, and not yet thoroughly tested). The FDA is still holding the reigns — it has the final say in determining that a drug or device is at least marginally safe — but it is setting aside the exhaustive testing and approval processes it normally requires before allowing general use.

Section IV to VI spell out what is and is not covered by this immunity during the Crisis, but it seems the standard being used is that the drug or device has a credible purpose in dealing with some aspect of Covid-19 and is not grossly or flagrantly irresponsible to use.
",Reasonable,"If you are a diehard Republican, you may be tempted to vote in a Democratic primary in order to boost one of their candidates that you believe may have a more difficult time during the general election than the other.  I have had republican friends telling me they keep cheering Bernie Sanders on, because in their perspective he will have a harder time getting elected than Hillary Clinton, for example.  This would be a bigger deal in election years where one party has a contested primary and the other one doesn't (meaning there's not too much of a reason for people to go vote in one of them, so why not vote in the other?). This happens generally every other presidential election cycle, since a president who can run for another term generally does so with their party's support.

Besides this fear of crossover voters 'stealing' the primary away from people who actually are in the party, one bonus purported from here is that a closed primary tends to let candidates talk more openly about their views during the primary since they are largely just speaking to their base.  This could let the party know more about the attitude of their base by seeing which candidates get better reactions from the issues they choose to support.  It should be noted that some look to this as one of the failings of the closed primary; politicians should stand for issues that are good for all of their constituents, not just those in their own party.

You hear pundits talk about the general election 'pivot' because of this, and why I'm not sure you can really take anything anyone says at face value during a primary election anyway.  Of course, as that link states, there's not much stopping me from changing party affiliation at any time and voting in whatever primary I choose.  ""Ultimately, the parties must trust voters.""

Lastly, here's a quote from Bernie Sanders printed by the NYTimes that points out in a closed primary, people who choose not to affiliate get left out:


  “Today, three million people in the state of New York who are Independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic and Republican primaries,” Mr. Sanders said standing alongside Mr. Cantalupo. “That’s wrong. You’re paying for this election. It’s administered by the state. You have a right to vote. That’s a very unfortunate thing which I hope will change.”


In my home state, the primary election is semi-closed, meaning independents can choose to vote in either the democratic or republican primaries.  The only catch is that, if there's a run-off in either, you can only vote in the run-off for the primary that you actually voted in.

(See, for example, here: https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/)

The main argument is that:


The bill allows prime minister Orban to rule by decree infinitely (at least as long as he sees fit) and that
There is no real need for these measures even during the current COVID-19 pandemic.


But what remains is the question whether there is any need for such measures. From my view as a outsider, I can't really see any benefits concerning the fight against the pandemic. Fidesz already has a two-third majority in parliament, enabling it to rule mostly unhindered and is even  able to change the constitution if deemed necessary. Any (tough) measures could probably be passed easily by Fidesz without Orbán having to be able to rule by decree.

Of course, if someone would like to transform the country into a dictatorship, these measures would make a lot of sense. But are there other reasons that may justify the necessity of the bill?
",52368,"Well, one obvious justification is that it means the parliament does not have to assemble. 


It is difficult to organize a parliamentary debate while keeping social distancing.
What if some legislators get into contact with an infected person. Could they still speak and cast their vote, or would they be banned during the quarantine period?


Of course the parliament could e.g. have put a narrow expiry date on the rules, but who knows how feasible a session would be three or six months from now? An expiry of ""after the pandemic"" would be too fuzzy. 



My personal opinion is that the parliament should have found a way to stay relevant, but the question asked for possible justifications.

An option might have been to change parliamentary rules to reduce the quorum, possibly combined with pairing, or to allow online debates and voting, but those are difficult for democracy as well.
",Reasonable,"WTO rules are much less favourable than the deal that the UK currently has with the EU. There would be mandatory tariffs in both directions, forcing up prices. The UK would lose things like EU certifications for aircraft and vehicles too.

WTO rules are designed to be a minimum level on which countries trade, only used in the absence of better deals.

There are also problems with the WTO rules themselves. For a start they require equal treatment for all countries operating under them, and given that the Irish border must remain open it's a problem for both the UK and EU. The EU would not want an open border with a WTO-rules country because it would be obliged to offer the same to all other WTO-rules countries, as would the UK. That threatens peace in Ireland and both economies.

Finally, it's not clear that the UK can actually trade on WTO rules as freely as some people claim. Other members have already lodged complaints over the UK's allocation of EU quotas, and in the event of a no-deal crash out would doubtless lodge more over the open border with Ireland. Disputes in the WTO take years to resolve and can be used as leverage to get trade deals less favourable to the UK.

9035,52399,Why is there no randomized testing of general population for coronavirus?,"Decision on how long to keep the economy ""shut down"" depends on the evaluation of how deadly/infectious coronavirus is. 

So I would assume that countries would try to test random members of ""healthy""(no sign of illness) population to determine the spread in the population.

I assume this was not done because tests are in high demand for people that exhibit symptoms, but could not find any confirmation for my thesis.

There is this question from 3 weeks ago, but from what I understand no answer claims there is a generalized sampling.
",52403,"This may seem counterintuitive, but constructing and administering a properly random testing paradigm is difficult and time-consuming. It's not as though we can gather everyone in a big room, put their names in a hat, and then call them out one-by-one to get tested. There are a number of different issues that need to be resolved, e.g.:


People are not randomly distributed. In the real world they cluster by race, religion, economic status, political affiliation, occupation, and other demographic factors. A purely random sample (unless it's immense) will likely underrepresent or overrepresent specific populations.
People are not easy to find. Say that Joe Smith is someone randomly chosen to be tested. What if we can't reach him by phone or email? What if we send a testing kit to him and he neglects to return it, or uses the kit incorrectly? What if we send a 'swabber' to his house, only to find he isn't home, or refuses to open the door? Depending on methodology, sampling in this context can have massive non-participation, and the more non-participants we see, the weaker our statistical results are.
People are not infected entirely randomly. Infections are a Markov chain, where one must be in specific kinds of contact with an infected person to have a chance of being infected, and then (if infected) must be in the same specific kinds of contact with uninfected people to pass it on. Modeling a Markov chain as though it were purely random misses important aspects of the way a disease is spread, and will skew results badly.
Perhaps most importantly, the spread of a pandemic is a fluid situation, not a stable characteristic of individuals. Collecting physical samples from people requires a tremendous amount of time and labor (driving to a home and collecting a sample, driving to another home and collecting a sample, repeat, repeat, drive back to homes where people were absent and try again). Even if we could muster a veritable army of 'swabbers' for our random sampling of nearly 400 million people, we can expect the actually swabbing to take at least a week (generously), and in a week the number of infections has doubled and doubled again. The first people swabbed are not being drawn from the same statistical population as the last people swabbed, and our statistics will suffer. And then we have to ask about our swabbers, who are all part of the population we are sampling, and all of whom have been exposed to large numbers of potentially infected people...


The upshot is that if we were to take the time to properly construct and implement a large-scale random sample, the disease would be spreading while we were designing the methodology, the disease would be spreading while we were implementing the testing, and by the time we finished running the data we collected the disease would have spread further, making our results all but useless. I'm not saying they would be entirely useless — with appropriate statistical manipulations we can account for many of these issues — but whatever use it has will be for future epidemiologists looking back on this pandemic.
",Reasonable,"As you indicate, we will ultimately need to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on such a question, but some analysis of our own can lead to a reasonable understanding of the argument that might be made.  

First, the only the thing that the Constitution actually says about the selection and voting of the state's electors is the following in Article II, Section 1, Clause 2:


  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
  may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
  Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
  Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
  Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed
  an Elector.


The key point of this statement is that the electors shall be appointed in a manner the state's legislature deems fit, not by some national or Constitutional standard.  As a result, many of the types of laws you highlight are going to be given a fair bit of leniency from the Supreme Court.  In fact, almost all election law in the United States is state law and that is why we see elections being carried out so differently from state to state with the state's Secretary of State presiding over and certifying elections.

9077,52414,Who was responsible for deciding the CDC would produce all COVID-19 tests instead of immediately opening up test production to the private sector?,"FactCheck.org considers Trumps claim that he inherited a broken CDC system to be 'misleading', and has given a long description of why they  made that ruling.  It effectively boils down to the claim that the CDC was never intended to be the sole producer of tests.  Instead they claim that the CDC was always intended to work with third parties and private sector to support the production of tests and other resources if a pandemic happened, and that the delays with testing was due to the CDC not allowing private sector agencies to build tests originally.

If it's true that the intent of the CDC was to support/regulate private sector test development, and that the CDC failed to do that, then the next question is why didn't it?  Why did the CDC not immediately open up production of tests to the private sector and support and vet those tests as factcheck.org claims was the original design intent?

Is there a specific individual or group of individuals who had the ability to decide to open up testing to private sector and failed to do it?  Was Trump or the white house in any way responsible for this decision to not open up testing to the private sector?
",52436,"Shorter answer: The Departments of the CDC, FDA, and HHS all are under the direction and guidance of the Trump administration. Failures of any one of these departments is the direct responsibility of the President. Parsing which department is most responsible for failure to immediately mobilize and deploy mass testing, while interesting, is an exercise in searching for a scapegoat.
",Reasonable,"There are two plausible explanations, the first being that they didn't want to contribute to further splitting the Remain-voting bloc, and the other being that they couldn't find a candidate in time.

To provide context to the situation alluded to in the question; originally the main Remain-supporting parties, the Greens, the Lib Dems, Renew, and Change UK had all planned to stand down their individual candidates and back an independent, pro-Remain candidate. This was decided on Tuesday the 7th of May, two days before the deadline to register candidates, to be Femi Oluwole. 

After wrestling with the decision on whether or not to stand for two days, Oluwole eventually decided not to run on the morning of the deadline. The reasons he gave for his refusal were fear of splitting the remain vote, handing victory to the Brexit party, lack of local ties to the area, inability to dedicate enough resources to the by-election while also working on the European elections, and ethical reasons related to his involvement in the Our Future Our Choice campaign which he co-founded. Oluwole threw his support behind the Labour candidate, who had not been involved with the talks to run a unity candidate, and indeed, as the link in the OP says, ""made it clear that they would strenuously disrupt the campaign and obstruct an independent candidate"".

Faced with less than 24 hours to choose candidates to run before the May 9th deadline, it seems that Change UK either failed to find a candidate willing to stand for the party, or decided that running another pro-Remain candidate would help hand victory to the Brexit party by taking votes from the Labour candidate. Given that the candidate that they ended up supporting in the by-election, Renew's Peter Ward, eventually won just 45 votes, it seems likely that the party had found that their level of local support was negligible, and therefore that running a candidate would be wasteful, given the upcoming European elections. It is also possible, given that in April, Renew announced that they would support Change UK in the European elections, that there was some sort of private deal between the parties to trade support and pool resources.

In conclusion, then, it seems that while there is a lack of clarity surrounding this decision, and certainly no official explanation of their decision-making process besides wanting to avoid splitting the vote, by reading between the lines somewhat we can identify most of the factors that will most likely have influenced the decision.

9078,52419,Why is the lack of seasonal agricultural workers considered a problem given the high unemployment rate in every Western country?,"Currently farmers in Western countries are warning governments that without foreign workers their fields will be impossible to harvest:


  “We are in need of a lot of foreign workers,” Eystein Ruud, a greenhouse farm owner and chairman of the Norwegian Horticultural Association, told The Globe and Mail. “If we cannot get these workers in the coming weeks, our farmers won’t risk putting a lot of plants in the soil. That may affect the food supply.”


At the same time Western nations are about to face unprecedented levels of unemployment due to the COVID-related shutdowns. On the face of it, this seems like a perfect match - people who lost their jobs could now work their local fields, earning a salary and supplying much needed food for the nation. So why is this considered a problem, rather than a blessing in disguise? Shouldn't governments be happy they have job openings for the unemployed?

I do understand that working the fields is difficult and only young people could do it, but currently a lot of young people lack a job too, so that looks like a manageable problem.
",52421,"I think these countries are in fact approaching this as a problem that has an obvious solution, as you suggest. The issue lies, however, with convincing their populace to work these seasonal jobs, and the inherent nature of seasonal agricultural work.

Firstly, the levels of unemployment are not necessarily going to be as bad as you might think, at least in some countries. Many western countries, including Norway, which you mention, and later, the UK, have implemented schemes which will allow companies to keep employees who have been furloughed due to the crisis on the payroll by covering a large portion of their wages. These schemes don't stop claimants from taking another job, at least in the UK's case, but potentially reduce the need for them to do so.

Secondly, the nature of this work means that for this to be a long-term job choice, workers need to be flexible and able to travel around the country. The BBC points out that 


  One reason overseas workers are recruited for these picking roles is
  that farmers require temporary, flexible workers who will move around
  the country following the crops.
  It is often difficult for local people to fill these roles as they are
  extremely busy for a short space of time - for example, two months to
  pick apples - with no work for the rest of the year.


So while it might be easy to find workers in one area of the country, it is currently infeasible given the COVID-19 crisis for workers to travel around the country as previously. Therefore, a much larger number of local workers need to be found in order to meet with local demand, rather than smaller groups of seasonal workers meeting the demand nationally.

Additionally, western Europeans are unused to this sort of work. According to the Independent:


  It's fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at
  seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the
  availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable
  surroundings.
  
  ""It's hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they
  do,"" says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of
  farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of
  England's vegetable production.
  
  ""It's not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys
  do,"" he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets'
  exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as
  how to cut it and pack it. For that they'll earn £12 an hour if
  they're good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised
  accommodation.


The seasonal workers that farms usually rely on, that know their trade and are experienced are unable to be used, so farmers are again being forced to engage a larger workforce than normal, in order to achieve a similar standard of work. This will, of course, entail higher costs, a longer training period, and presumably, a lower yield as mistakes are made.

Governments are trying to deal with this problem by pushing the solution you suggest - the Independent reports again:


  So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its
  own ""Pick for Britain"" campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army
  that tilled the fields during the Second World War.


In Norway, the government has introduced a scheme which will encourage employees laid off by their employer to work in agricultural roles:


  New legislation means that if a worker is laid off and takes up an
  agricultural role, he or she will be able to earn both a salary from
  the farmer as well as half his or her unemployment benefit.


It's not so much that the solution to the problem isn't obvious, it's that due to a combination of the nature of seasonal agricultural work, and the complications introduced by the current crisis, the problem is harder to solve than at first glance.

9081,52446,Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?,"Romania has virtually the worst public health system in EU and there is no surprise that it is far from being prepared for tackling the coronavirus infection.

On major issue is that corruption (e.g. among hospital managers) has led to hospitals to not have the minimum equipment (masks, gloves) not even for a week or two. 

In this context lots of medical workers got infected and quite a lot decided to quit. The government wants to tackle this issue by either withdrawing their right to practice medicine or expanding their notice period.

Since Romania already has a significant medical staff deficit, the second option is more likely. Currently the law mentions a 20 working days period notice (~ 1 month), but the government is considering 60 working days (~ 3 months). Based on some epidemic spreading simulations this will cover the worst period of the epidemics. This means de facto forcing the medical staff to face the infection without proper equipment.

Working without proper equipment means a much higher chance of getting infected, infecting colleagues and patients.

There was a lot of debate over this issue and I am wondering if such measures are compatible with EU laws or the emergency sate can simply override some EU laws that have priority over national laws. 

Question: Can an EU country government force its medical doctors work with SARS-CoV2 infected patients without the proper equipment?

Note: Some equipment was indeed received very recently, a few weeks after the first coronavirus case was officially confirmed in Romania.
",52546,"The EU directives and regulations with respect to ""Workplaces, equipment, signs and personal protective equipment"" can be found here. The directive that I think is most relevant is Directive 89/656/EEC - use of personal protective equipment.

This directive sets minimum standards for PPE used by workers, and states the obligations that employers have on this matter:


  Personal protective equipment must be used when the risks cannot be
  avoided or sufficiently limited by technical means of collective
  protection or procedures of work organization.
  
  All personal protective equipment must:
  
  
  be appropriate for the risks involved, without itself leading to any increased risk
  correspond to existing conditions at the workplace
  take account of ergonomic requirements and the worker's state of health
  fit the wearer correctly after any necessary adjustment.
  
  
  The employer must provide the appropriate equipment free of charge and
  must ensure that it is in good working order and hygienic condition.


When defining what this directive covers, the following exceptions are noted:


  The definition in paragraph 1 excludes:
  
  (a) ordinary working clothes and uniforms not specifically designed to
  protect the safety and health of the worker;
  
  (b) equipment used by emergency and rescue services;
  
  (c) personal protective equipment worn or used by the military, the
  police and other public order agencies;
  
  (d) personal protective equipment for means of road transport;
  
  (e) sports equipment;
  
  (f) self-defence or deterrent equipment;
  
  (g) portable devices for detecting and signalling risks and nuisances.


None of these exceptions would seem to cover medical workers except the rather non-specific ""emergency and rescue services"". I would take that to mean paramedics, ambulance staff, and mountain rescue workers and the like, however it is possible that this clause could be used to exempt general medical workers from this protection.

Specifically in the case of Romania, this directive has been implemented in national law by ""Hotărâre privind cerinţele minime de securitate şi sănătate pentru utilizarea de către lucrători a echipamentelor individuale de protecţie la locul de muncă"", or ""Decision concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace"". From my rudimentary translation of the law, this appears to be pretty much word for word a translation of the original directive.

At first glance then, it seems that failing to provide adequate PPE for hospital staff is a breach of the employer's obligations under this EU directive. However, there are a number of exceptions noted in the directive, not to mention exceptions in national law, which could be used to exclude hospital workers from the protection. In addition, a few national governments have not implemented the directive into national law yet. This makes it difficult to give a definitive answer before this is tested in the courts, as a Spanish doctor's union is attempting.
",Reasonable,"Rent for new buildings isn't capped (at least not by this new law), so the cap shouldn't interfere with new buildings. Rent may also be increased up to a point when a building is modernized.

The cap was implemented because the market didn't work for a lot of people who needed to spend more and more of their income on rent or be driven out of Berlin. The market also failed to build an adequate amount of new housing before the cap (fewer housing than needed for new residents were build, and the city actually build 25% of new housing itself). Experience has also shown that the market reacts to new buildings not with lower, but with increased rent. And despite the high need for affordable apartments, there was a high amount of vacancy. Because of this, the cap was very popular among voters (over 70% approval).

9101,52468,Why do governments downplay or cover-up pandemics in their early stages?,"CONTEXT

While no government wants there to be a pandemic, and would certainly prefer (hope) for it to just go away, they can only downplay it for a short time before it overwhelms the population and they must address it from a significantly weaker position than if they had acted decisively at the beginning.

In the smartphone era, information propagates instantly through informal networks (Facebook, WeChat, StackExchange, etc.) and is difficult to suppress.

QUESTIONS

After witnessing the COVID epidemic and failure to contain it in Asia, it spread to Europe and was poised to infect the west. Why did western hemisphere leaders downplay the pandemic’s threat instead of acknowledging the problem and communicating what would be done to reverse the issue?  What is the political incentive for deferring acknowledgement and action?
",52469,"In hindsight it's clear that many governments should have taken the risk of a Covid19 pandemic much more seriously, but it's not that easy to anticipate the reach and intensity of the epidemic before it happens. There have been other serious threats before for which the containment strategy proved sufficient, and if a government allocates resources (for instance massive purchases of masks and ventilators) which end up wasted they are going to be criticized as well. 

This article in the Guardian argues that most European countries were not as well prepared as some Asian countries because:


There was no recent experience of a serious epidemic in the country,
causing leaders to subconsciously underestimate the seriousness of
the threat.
There is a potential political cost for a government if they invest
resources by precaution and the risk doesn't materialize:


  ""The challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. If you act swiftly and the outbreak isn’t as bad as
  feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. If you
  adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government
  gets criticised for underreacting,"" says Steve Taylor, professor at
  the University of British Columbia and author of The Psychology of
  Pandemics.


As an example, during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic
Roselyne Bachelot was Minister of Health in the French
government. She purchased 94 million vaccines, but only a small
proportion turned out to be actually used. As a result she was
widely criticized for wasting public money. I assume that there are
other examples of this kind, where a politician loses some political
points because they made a safe but costly decision.


It seems that when an epidemic threat presents itself a government must make a call between:


Taking the threat seriously and therefore mobilizing important resources for an overall unlikely epidemic crisis, with a high risk to appear as overreacting and wasting public money.
Taking minimal conservative measures, which is unlikely to be sufficient if the crisis materializes. However this will likely appear as the ""normal"" choice to make, since nobody could objectively have anticipated the intensity of the crisis.


Note: this answer is made of recycled material from a closed question of mine.
",Reasonable,"
  Why do governments downplay or cover-up pandemics in their early stages?


Because most problems disappear over time, even when nothing is done. So why would anyone enact unpopular measures if there is a chance those are not needed?

SARS, H1N1, Ebola: in all those cases this strategy worked or would have worked. COVID-19 is the exception to the rule.

Politicians who kick the can down the road, will barely ever be held responsible for past mistakes. If some decision turns out to be wrong many years later - a big if - the politician is already in some other role where people don't even know about that past mistake. While the current one responsible will just blame the predecessor. Everyone escapes responsibility in practice.

As a result, ""kicking the can down the road"" is a valid strategy for politicians. In fact, as almost all politicians at the higher levels act that way, it looks like it is requirement to survive the lower tiers.

The uniqueness of COVID-19 is the speed with which inactivity is exposed and punished. The ones who didn't act quick enough two months ago, are still in power.

9103,52507,Is the correlation between the economy and US political outcomes weakening?,"I have heard about the saying “It’s the economy stupid”, but I’m not sure about how true it is now. 

Let’s use Trump’s approval as an example. Even though there is a “rally around the flag effect” that is typical of leaders during crises (it is a lot smaller than governors and foreign leaders and especially President Bush in 2001), it does show that despite the stock market crashing, his approval continued to rise before presumably hitting a ceiling of about 46% on 538. For more context, in the years before, at 538, his approval was hovering at around 43% despite a relatively strong economy. 

I have read that the economy is not affecting people’s voting habits nearly as much as it used to. Is that true?
",52510,"Firstly, to address the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the popularity of Donald Trump; the level of correlation between the performance of the economy and US presidential popularity is well studied. For example, LSE research in 2013 found that presidential approval is highly sensitive to changes in the share index:


  A positive change in the index, when controlling for other relevant
  factors, on average produces an increase in the President’s approval. 
  Interestingly, the effect is even more pronounced when we look at
  market acceleration or deceleration. When the market is growing at an
  increasing rate, voters reward the president, but when growth is
  decelerating, the president is punished.


You are right that President Trump's current opinion polls would seem to buck this trend, as the stock market has plummeted, with the Dow Jones crashing around 8000 points since the end of February, while the President enjoys record high approval ratings of 49% according to Gallup. However, I would argue that instead of an indication that these two measures are no longer intrinsically linked, they are rather an exception to the rule, precedent for which already exists.

We can, for example, consider the performance of the stock market in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, with the NYSE and the Nasdaq closing for almost a week, the Dow Jones falling 14%, and the NYSE market falling by 7.1%, a record at the time. Clearly in normal times, this would have led to a dramatic fall in presidential approval. However, as you note in your question, President Bush's approval rating soared to around 90%, the highest ever for a US president, and would go on to gradually lower over his tenure as President.

Another example might be the Gulf War in 1991. Although this took place in the middle of a recession, which had lowered the approval of President Bush Snr., his victory in the crisis gave him record approval ratings. This lead was, however, squandered over the next year, as Gallup puts it: ""Americans' attention shifted from the Persian Gulf to the struggling U.S. economy"". He would, of course, go on to lose the 1992 election to Bill Clinton.

It seems, therefore, that rather than this incongruency representing a break from the established conventional wisdom that presidential approval, and as a result, US political outcomes, mirrors the stock market, it is at least at the moment a reflection of previous examples of the 'rally around the flag' effect that you note in your question. Whether or not Trump's approval rating continues to stay at this high level will depend on how his response to the crisis is judged by the American public.

Secondly, to evaluate the scope of your question more generally, there is a growing body of research which seems to support your notion that the aforementioned link between the performance of the economy and the electoral outcomes of incumbent politicians is becoming weaker, at least in the US. 

For example, the NYT conducted a survey (notably before the current pandemic) weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States, in which public opinion regarding Trump's handling of the economy was tested. The full results can be found here. Their analysis suggests that:


  Economic conditions have historically been among the best predictors
  of presidential elections, and models based on those patterns suggest
  that Mr. Trump would be favored to win re-election if the economy
  remains more or less on its current path through Election Day. But it
  is unclear whether historical lessons hold in an era of heightened
  partisanship.


In particular, SurveyMonkey, who conducted the poll, note that


  When asked which political party in general does a better job handling
  the economy, the public is locked in a 45-45 deadlock. Republicans
  overwhelmingly (95%) favor the Republican party, while Democrats
  overwhelmingly (88%) favor the Democratic party. Independents are
  split, with 39% favoring the Democrats and 36% favoring the
  Republicans.


It would seem according to this research, that although ""Jobs and the economy"" remains the most important issue for the largest proportion (24%) of the survey participants, their other partisan beliefs are unlikely to shake their party loyalty in the wake of a change in economic fortunes.

In addition, 538 has a great article on this, which I won't go into too much detail on because this answer is already pretty long, but in particular, Silver notes that:


  In particular, we don’t have enough data to make overly specific
  claims about the economy. That is, any time you see what you might
  call a “magic bullet” claim, such as that second-quarter GDP is
  crucial or that per-capita disposable income is the key economic
  variable, you should be wary.


Although he also echoes the misgivings of the NYT article, that partisanship could dull the response to a recession, he maintains that the performance of the economy is still very important to the outcome for the incumbent party - ""The better off America is by November, the more likely he is to be re-elected.""

In conclusion, then, although there is evidence to suggest that the conventional link between the economy and the fate of incumbent officials is weakening due to increased polarization and partisanship, the link is still undeniably extant. While in this specific case around the COVID-19 pandemic the incongruency can perhaps be explained by the 'rally 'round the flag' effect, it seems likely that the ultimate fate of Trump's 2020 campaign will be defined by his response to the pandemic and the underlying economical issues over the coming months. It is still far too early, in my opinion, to write off our conventional knowledge based on a few opinion polls conducted during a crisis.
",Reasonable,"The state of the economy is a strong indicator for political outcomes because the economy is persistent in people's minds. Wars come and go, crises come and go, pandemics come and go, but the economy is always there in the background, and it's what people always return to worry about when more dramatic worries fade in their minds.

Trump presents an unusual case in US politics for two (interconnected) reasons. First, and most obviously, Trump's entire political strategy is the creation of a continuous stream of mini-crises: endless insults, attacks, and divisive speech; sudden policy reversals or spontaneous 'gut' decisions that throw planning and preparation into disarray; bald-faced lies and misstatements that create conflict and distrust; etc. This has the effect of keeping the populace in a state of constant distracted agitation that makes that natural return to concerns about economic policy difficult. Combine this continuous agitation with Trump's patronizing and self-aggrandizing assertions that 'his' economy is the 'best ever', and that may be sufficient to mute the kinds of economic problems that ultimately sank W and HW Bush's approval rating.

Second — and this is a bit more abstract and philosophical — Trump is the titular leader of what Madison referred to as a 'faction' (see: Federalist #10), but a faction on a scale we have not yet encountered in US history. In Madison's words, a faction is:


  [...] a number of citizens, whether amounting to
  a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by
  some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights
  of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the
  community.


This 'common impulse of passion' — which in the case of Trumpism I think of as neo-colonial exceptionalism: the idea that the 'perfect union' of the original colonists has been disrupted by 'outsiders' (brown people, Jews and Muslims, Leftists, feminists...) — is an overriding factor that (thus far) has kept Trump's approval rating from dropping below the mid-30's regardless of actual government outcomes. Whether that deep factional base will survive pandemic deaths and the collapse of the economy remains to be seen, but it is a force to be reckoned with.

The economy is still, and always will be, a significant factor in political life. At the end of the day, and after every crisis, people are going to worry about their mortgages, their social standing, the food on their table and the money in their bank accounts. That will never change. The political question, however, is whether and to what extent other supervening factors can be leveraged for political advantage over and above that economic given.

  Is there any international travel rule which prohibits a country from refusing entry to its own citizens?


Yes.


  The Right of return  is a principle in international law which guarantees everyone's right of voluntary return to or re-enter their country of origin or of citizenship. 
  
  The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1948 Fourth Geneva Convention. The Geneva Conventions, it has been argued, have passed into customary international law and that the right of return is binding on non-signatories to the conventions




The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights says


  Article 13.
  
  (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.
  (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

",Reasonable,"The United States (US) only has two parties because of the way that presidential elections work.  In general, plurality voting systems lead to two parties.  You can read more about why at Duverger's law.  The basic idea is that plurality voting forces voters to choose which governing coalition should win the district before voting and the presidency is basically a national district.  

In other systems, voters have more ability to choose parties that represent them better.  In the US, they have to vote for atypical members of their parties, e.g. Blue Dog Democrats or Main Street Republicans.  In many other systems, those would be different parties.  The Congressional Black Caucus and Tea Party might also have been separate parties in other countries.  

The United Kingdom (UK) can have more than two parties because it is a parliamentary system (although still with plurality voting).  So while each district only has one or two serious parties, different districts can have different pairs.  Because the country as a whole has multiple parties, it is easier for the pairs to change in a district.  This helps avoid the stabilization into a two party system.  Note that it is still dominated by two parties.  Either Labour or the Tories are always in the governing coalition and have been since the demise of the Liberal party.  

In the last general election, the Tories used the promise of a referendum to keep the party from splitting into pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit factions.  One can view the pro-Brexit faction as having some similarity to the Tea Party movement in the US.  The Scottish National Party has some similarities to the Congressional Black Caucus.  It votes almost exclusively with Labour (vs. the Tories), but in the UK, it is a separate party rather than a Labour faction.  

Since 1996, New Zealand has had a form of proportional representation.  Proportional representation encourages multiple parties as it is easier for small parties to get enough votes for representation.  People can choose a party that represents almost all of their beliefs.  The parties then choose a governing coalition that makes reasonable compromises.  Parties that don't support enough of the governing coalition's agenda join the opposition instead.  

New Zealand is not the only country with proportional representation.  It's actually rather common.  And in general, those countries have multiple parties in both the governing coalition and the opposition.

If a vacancy occurs after that time, the office shall appear on the state election ballot that November.

  In Massachusetts a bill was passed in response to the death of Senator Edward Kennedy and his request that the current law be changed.  Previous law in Massachusetts called for a special election to be held, but not until five months after the vacancy occurs.  The new law retains the special election, but permits the governor to appoint a temporary successor in the interim.


https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vacancies-in-the-united-states-senate.aspx

In 2004, to prevent the Republican Governor from appointing a Republican, the Democrat legislature passed laws which mandated a special election.  However in 2009, when Ted Kennedy died, there was a desire that the post should be filled promptly, and the law was amended so that the Governor could make an interim appointment.

The timings are further complicated by the postponement of elections due to COVID-19 restrictions.  However it seems reasonably clear that 


The Governor can only appoint an interim senator.
The Governor cannot be overruled by the legislature, but the legislature can amend the law before the Governor makes their choice.
The timing of the special election is about 5 months after the post falls vacant.

",Reasonable,"
In countries where human rights are applied, they are, as you say, ""core"" values. So ""core"" that, when they are applied, it makes no sense / gives no useful information just to say that you are ""pro-human rights parties"".

Imagine the USA Democratic or Republican party running an ad saying that they are against slavery, or people being put in jail without due process. At best, it is time wasted because it will neither report to the voters any new information nor remark any difference against the other political parties. At worst, the public will be confused as why the party feels they need to make such a pointless statement (imagine Obama addressing the nation to state that he is against using the CIA to kill Republican politicans).
In countries were human rights are not applied, there are usually parties that try to promote them. Note that in many cases, they will not defend them collectively, but rather the individual rights. This is useful because:


people will understand more easily ""freedom of association"" than a more abstract ""human rights"".
""Human rights"" as a label may be seen as an external politic guideline (decided by a few countries), strange to the country culture (for example, Chinese officials often claims that the concept of the Human Rights is the product of Western culture and not appliable to Chinese politics. Defending particular rights is a way to bypass that affirmation and focus in the actual rights being demanded.
Some countries may be receptive to some Human Rights and not to others, for example maybe Saudi Arabia is more receptive to allowing association rights than, say, religious freedom or women's rights. Even people who are in favour of all the ""Human rights"" may chose to demand only those that are realistic demands.
And last but not least, in many countries without Human Rights, demanding the Government to change its polices is heavily prosecuted, both legally and illegally.

9133,52590,"What was WHO's defence from US Republican attacks that the WHO ""really blew"" their response to the pandemic by being ""slow"" and ""deceptive""?","As reported on the BBC today:


  The [US] president accused the WHO of being ""very China-centric"" and said they ""really blew"" their pandemic response.
  
  Dr Tedros has now dismissed the comments, insisting: ""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.""
  
  After first attacking the WHO on Tuesday, President Trump renewed his criticism at his press briefing on Wednesday, saying the organization must ""get its priorities right"". He said the US would conduct a study to decide whether the US would continue paying contributions [...]
  
  On Tuesday, President Trump had said the WHO appeared to be ""very biased toward China"".
  
  ""They called it wrong. They really - they missed the call,"" he said. ""And we're going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We're going to put a very powerful hold on it, and we're going to see.""


Clearly (from the same article) Tedros has rejected the notion that the WHO has a China-bias, but have they said anything more specifically rejecting the other accusations, i.e. that they ""really blew"" their response and that they ""missed the call"" (when the pandemic started)?

Similarly,


  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump, vowed there would not be any funding for the WHO in the next Senate appropriations bill.
  
  ""I'm in charge of the appropriations subcommittee. I'm not going to support funding the WHO under its current leadership. They've been deceptive, they've been slow, and they've been Chinese apologists,"" Graham said in an interview with Fox News.
  
  Last week, Republican Senator Marco Rubio called for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying ""he allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community"".


These latter accusations from Republican senators are even more direct and specific (than ""blew""), accusing the WHO of deliberate deception, in cahoots with Beijing, besides being ""slow"".

Thanks to @ItalianPhilosophers for finding this, Fox News has been emphasizing this bit in their coverage of the Republican-WHO spat:


  Last month, Taiwan accused the WHO of ignoring a warning it sent in December about human-to-human transmission of coronavirus. “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China,” the organization tweeted in January.


Which may be what the US Republicans are alluding to with ""slow"".

Somewhat more obvious/predictible, Fox News is critical of the WHO's criticism of the US travel ban:


  the WHO responded to Trump’s travel ban on foreign nationals coming from China by saying that “travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation” of coronavirus cases and instead could have a “have a significant economic and social impact.”
  
  Criticism of the travel ban and other pro-China statements have brought renewed questions about the U.S. funding the agency.


(The latter issue has been the topic of two separate questions here e.g., so I don't want to reash that.)

If the WHO itself has not replied to those (other) allegations of Trump/Republicans/Fox-News/Taiwan more specifically, has the WHO's record in this respect been defended by others, e.g. has the press said anything in support/defence of WHO's actions in response to the pandemic that can address some of Trump's accusations (from those quotes that I have emphasized)?
",52593,"For what's worth it, Al Jazeera quoted a third-party defence of the WHO:


  Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said the last thing the US and the WHO need right now is this sort of a fight.
  
  ""It is a distraction from the need to focus on defeating this pandemic,"" he told Al Jazeera.
  
  ""No virus has a nationality and it is down to how the countries have handled the threat. The core information that was needed to understand this risk was available by the end of January - and it was available through the WHO. That information still is very accurate in terms of transmissibility and lethality of this disease, so that really should have been all for any country to take it seriously,"" Konyndyk said.
  
  ""In general, I think the WHO has been further ahead of the curve and understanding the risk of the virus than Trump's own administration has, so I don't think WHO is to be blamed for the US's sluggish response."" 


And also added this on their own:


  The WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency on January 30, nearly a month before Trump tweeted: ""The coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,"" and a full 43 days before he declared a national emergency in the US.


I'll accept a better answer in the sense that I asked in the question, i.e. if the WHO themselves explicitly defended their record/actions in response to those Republican accusations.



Similarly the Guardian has an article defending the WHO with extensive quotes from experts and among those they've quoted a WHO official too  (Lawrence Gostin):


  WHO’s total annual budget is about $2.5bn, and contributions from member states have not significantly increased over three decades.
  
  “The WHO’s budget is around the equivalent of a large US hospital, which is utterly incommensurate with its global responsibilities,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University. [He also holds a WHO position, as made clear later in the article.] “So, if the US president were a global health leader, he’d be leading a call to at minimum double the WHO budget in the face of this pandemic.” [...]
  
  “I have been a longstanding critic and I’ve described their performance on Ebola as catastrophic. But I think overall their performance on this outbreak has been, not perfect, but pretty good,” Ashish Jha, a public health professor at Harvard, said.
  
  “They’ve been very transparent as much as they have known the data. They have had daily calls, they have been very clear about the severity of this illness, and how the global community has to respond.”
  
  Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, took part in WHO conference calls about coronavirus from 7 January, according to sources familiar with the conversations.
  
  Gavin Yamey, the director of Duke University’s center for policy impact in global health, said: “If the United States had followed the WHO’s very clear advice on identifying cases, isolating cases and conducting contact tracing, then it wouldn’t be in the appalling situation that it is in today.”
  
  Despite its declaration, the WHO did not advocate travel restrictions of the sort imposed by Trump a day later on non-American travellers arriving from China. The president has pointed to this as an example of bad advice. But Gostin, who is director of the WHO centre on global health law, said that the organisation cannot generally call for travel bans under international law – and such bans can be counterproductive, leading countries to withhold vital information for fear of economic isolation.
  
  “To blame the WHO for acting on the basis of international law and science in ways that are entirely consistent with what WHO practices have been for decades is the height of hypocrisy,” he said.
  
  Trump claimed that his ban “shut down” intercontinental transmission of the virus, but an ABC television investigation found that there were 3,200 flights from China to the US in the critical period between December and March.


The Guardian article does grant the WHO critics some points on Taiwan:


  The US president’s accusations that the WHO is “China-centric” have more resonance with public health scholars. The WHO has largely excluded Taiwan from its discussions, and dodged questions about the Taiwanese response, which has been one of the most effective. But because of pressure from Beijing – which sees Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and opposes any form of recognition – the blindspot is a UN-wide phenomenon.
  
  “I think the effusive praise for China, in the early days, was probably unnecessary,” Jha said.
  
  Amanda Glassman, the executive vice-president and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said a deeper problem is the WHO’s low budget and relatively toothless structure. Unlike the nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has no redress against governments that do not cooperate.
  
  “It operates in countries at the pleasure and permission of the host country governments. So in the case of China, to be allowed to enter China, it was a negotiation to get there,” Glassman said.

",Reasonable,"When a candidate gets a majority in the first round, there is no difference. It is also usually possible to determine that all but the top two candidates did not win, even if it is not possible to immediately determine which of the top two candidates did win in IRV (although it is often possible to make a very good guess about that point based on the similarities and differences of the candidates who remain in the running to those who are eliminated).

When no candidate receives a majority, as in Maine this year where the process was used for the first time, it took three or four extra weeks. But, some of this delay was because the process had to be implemented for the very first time in the history of that system being in place. It would probably be possible to shave a week or two off that time frame if the system were more familiar to election officials from prior use. If electronic voting systems, rather than paper ballots were used, it would have been possible to get the instant runoff result immediately, but that would come with downsides with regard to the degree to which the result could be audited.

This is several weeks shorter than a true runoff election in states like Louisiana and Georgia and California where that is held if no candidate wins a majority.

Of course, races where no one candidate receives a majority aren't all that common, a fair number of close races are delayed for a week or two for a recount because the outcome was very close, WA state results are always delayed for a week or two since ballots can be postmarked on election day and received afterwards, and the cases that result in recounts in FPTP overlap somewhat with races in which no candidate receives a majority. So, the extent to which the process delays the last election result being finally decided is quite a bit shorter. Also, while most constituencies in the U.S. get a result that can be called on election night, a significant minority every year do not because vote counting precedes more quickly in some places than others, so even without significant delays, it almost always takes 2-3 days to get a final result. 

U.S. ballots take much longer than U.K. and Canadian ballots to count, in part, because U.S. ballots typically each include dozens of candidates and issues (from districts that do not have the same boundaries), and all of the constituencies in the U.K. and Canada are fairly small (and similar in size) compared to an entire U.S. state, a U.S. Congressional District, or a large U.S. county like Los Angeles (with 10.16 million people), while U.K. and Canadian ballots typically involve only a single candidate race on each ballot. Also, election administration in the U.S. is much more fragmented administratively with many more or less independent bodies handling this task.

The last election for Congress in the 2018 election that was decided, in NC where there was election fraud by Republican operatives in excess of the GOP margin of victory wasn't resolved in time for anyone from that seat to be elected by January 3, 2019 when everyone else was sworn in this year.

Thus, it is also important to distinguish between cases where the determination of which party received a majority of the legislative body are delayed v. cases where the determination of the exact extent to which the leading party or coalition has a majority is at stake. Unless the overall national outcome is almost perfectly 50-50, delays from counting non-majority races won't prevent the public from knowing which party will be in control of a body within 2-3 days.

9163,52602,When did the WHO decide there was evidence of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19?,"A January 14 WHO tweet that has been widely re-broadcast months later by the right-wing US press (e.g. NYPost, WashExam but not exclusively by them, e.g. Bloomberg opinion piece, Politico o.p.) said that:


  Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.


The WHO is lampooned for this moment by the aforementioned media pieces, but these don't really say when the WHO came to a different conclusion regarding human-to-human transmission. So when did that happen, and what information source did the WHO use for the latter determination?
",52604,"The WHO was clearly wary that human-to-human transmission may be a factor at the beginning of January - although their initial Disease Outbreak News (DON) of January 5th entitled ""Pneumonia of unknown cause – China"" states that:


  According to the authorities, some patients were operating dealers or
  vendors in the Huanan Seafood market. Based on the preliminary
  information from the Chinese investigation team, no evidence of
  significant human-to-human transmission and no health care worker
  infections have been reported.


They also note that all patients are being isolated, and that close contacts of patients are being identified and monitored, which indicates that this avenue was being investigated.

Further advice published on 10th January also indicated that:


  From the currently available information, preliminary investigation
  suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and
  no infections among health care workers have occurred.


But again, warned that travellers should take measures such as


  
  avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
  frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
  travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes
  with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
  


According to the WHO COVID-19 Timeline's entry for January 14th:


  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove noted in a press briefing there had been
  limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus (in the 41
  confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a
  risk of a possible wider outbreak. Dr. Kerkhove noted that
  human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our
  experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.


After WHO officials from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan from the 20th-21st of Jan, the latter office published a twitter thread on January 21st stating that as a result of the increasing number of cases of the virus; ""It is now very clear [...] that there is at least some human-to-human transmission of #nCoV2019"". The thread also states that ""more information and analysis are needed on this new virus to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission and other important details"". 

Additionally, on the 21st of January, the DON for the spread of the disease in the Republic of Korea contained the phrase ""the extent of human-to-human transmission"", the first DON not to question the existence of human-to-human transmission, but rather its extent.

A more formal announcement was made by the WHO mission to China on the 22nd of January which states that:


  Data collected through detailed epidemiological investigation and
  through the deployment of the new test kit nationally suggests that
  human-to-human transmission is taking place in Wuhan. More analysis of
  the epidemiological data is needed to understand the full extent of
  human-to-human transmission. WHO stands ready to provide support to
  China to conduct further detailed analysis.


In conclusion then, while human-to-human transmission was suspected to be present from the initial WHO DON on January 5th, this was not confirmed until after data observed in the field in Wuhan by members of the WHO China &amp; Western Pacific regional offices was thought to show that human-to-human transmission was clearly a factor. These field investigations took place on the 20th-21st of January, and announcements acknowledging this conclusion were first made on the 21st.
",Reasonable,"Background

H.R.5325 was a continuing resolution to fund the government from October 1, 2016, through December 9, 2016.

On September 22, 2016, in the Senate, S.Amdt.5082 (aka SA 5082) was proposed to amend H.R.5325.

Sen. McConnell, the majority leader, proposed SA 5083 through SA 5089.


  SA 5083. This Act shall take effect 1 day after the date of enactment.
  
  SA 5084. Strike ‘‘1 day’’ and insert ‘‘2 days’’.
  
  SA 5085. This Act shall take effect 3 days after the date of enactment.
  
  SA 5086. Strike ‘‘3 days’’ and insert ‘‘4 days’’.
  
  SA 5087. This Act shall take effect 5 days after the date of enactment.
  
  SA 5088. Strike ‘‘5’’ and insert ‘‘6’’. 
  
  SA 5089. Strike ‘‘6’’ and insert ‘‘7’’. 


Immediately following this series of amendments, Sen. McConnell called for cloture to end debate. The cloture vote was taken on September 27, 2016. It failed 45 - 55.

Additional amendments were considered; then on the 28th, SA 5082 passed, whereupon, Sen.McConnell withdrew, by unanimous consent, his prior amendments from September 22nd.



Questions


  Why were these amendments introduced to H.R. 5325 in this manner?
  
  Is there a reason why this series of amendments were introduced like this?
  
  Could an enactment date not be changed with one amendment or does it have to go through increments like this?
  
  Is it a tactic to stall similar to quorum calls to allow for additional time to work on this bill?




Answer

The Legislative Process on the Senate Floor: An Introduction, p 11.


  Majority leaders of the Senate have sometimes offered a series of amendments, one immediately after another, taking up available slots for pending amendments for the purpose of “freezing” the amendment process so that no other amendments can be offered (except by unanimous consent) at that time.




It should be noted that had SA 5082 failed completely, it would have required reconsideration of H.R.5325. In that case, Sen. Reid, the minority leader, had nine amendments ready (SA 5094 - SA 5102), apparently, to prevent Senators from introducing other amendments to H.R.5325.

9164,52628,Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?,"This article shows us that some US institutions rely on very old systems (written decades ago, which is very long in IT time perspective):


  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says that the state is looking for
  volunteers with skills that can be used to help in the COVID-19
  coronavirus outbreak, and one of those skills is knowing your way
  around a 61-year-old programming language used on big, old, mainframe
  computers. 
  
  COBOL is an old computer programming language that was first developed
  in the 1950′s in conjunction with the Department of Defense. Today,
  most programmers prefer and use more modern languages, but there are
  pockets where old software written in COBOL remains in use,
  particularly financial applications and in large enterprises or
  government agencies.


I understand that state institutions are typically much slower that private companies when it comes to IT investments, but having such old systems seems strange. Relying on systems written so much time ago incurs lots of issues which translates to wasted time and money:


initial developments done way before modern software development frameworks were around us
it is much harder to find specialists which know the language, but also are able to adapt to such an old software development style
inability to act in a timely fashion when changes or maintenance must be performed (e.g. Coronavirus outbreak)


It makes for banks to be reluctant to rewriting their systems due to big costs and risks, since they must also make profit. But a public institution is not profit based and in theory can easier invest in modernizing their software systems.

Question: Why did some US institutions not migrate their very old software systems to use somewhat newer ones?

Note: I am not thinking about big leaps, but at least to work with languages and frameworks that are at most 20 years old, not 60 years old. 



While the main arguments are related to software development risks, I am interested in the political aspect of the ""why"", since we are talking about public institutions making the decision to partially / totally rewrite some systems. Such aspects might be related to the size of projects or quality of management in the public sector.
",52630,"It's not just US institutions, there are many countries, institutions - including banks - and companies running on ancient software and hardware.

There are multiple reasons for that:

First, from the business standpoint, replacing software costs money. Why spend money to replace something that already meets requirements? If you have software A that does what you want, already exists and is ""free"", since you already own it, and software B, which doesn't exist yet, costs years of development time, probably requires new hardware and has the associated costs for all of that, which would your boss or your (often very much non-technical) boss
's boss approve? What would a government employee with a tight budget approve? What would a politician calling for less government spending approve?

Secondly, the exact workings of the system are often lost in time. No one actually knows what the system does exactly, but it interfaces with dozens of other systems through APIs that are equally unknown, obscure or deprecated. Creating a specification for such a system that a contractor/contracted company can work with is difficult, if not impossible. There is a huge risk that the resulting system will not replicate the behavior of the old system and stuff will stop working. It might do things like round .5 up instead of rounding to even like the old system, which could cause all the bills or transactions to suddenly be off by 1 cent compared to the previous system.
In government, a broken system could mean that the unemployed might not get their benefits, the tax payers not their yearly tax payback or any number of things that will lead to an elected politician not being reelected. Politicians like being reelected, so even if they understand the technical need, which is rare anyways, they might avoid the risks for political reasons. Often there were attempts at replacing the system, which then failed and then those failures get pointed at whenever someone proposes replacing the system.

Thirdly, the old systems usually have a very bad user interface. A new system will have a shiny, new interface, sometimes because creating the old interface wouldn't even be feasible in a new application. This requires training people. People that have worked in the company or institution for 40-50 years and are very set in their ways. Those people often have a lot of blocking power, which can completely halt development on the new system, because their requirements, i.e. ""don't change anything,"" aren't met. They are usually also very hard to fire and replace, so the institution has to hire new people without firing them, which requires a bigger budget, which comes back to the first point.

9165,52636,"Are there any polls explicitly measuring ""quarantine fatigue"" in Western countries?","There are numerous articles talking about how people are tired of staying in lockdown:


  As Greece enters its third week since restrictive measures were first
  imposed to combat the spread of coronavirus, there is mounting concern
  that fatigue is setting in amid signs of people beginning to flout the
  policies.
  
  Speaking to ANT1 TV, the government spokesman Stelios Petsas said the
  centre-right administration was now considering placing a time limit
  on the movement of citizens outdoors, the Guardian reports.


Are there any polls which attempt to track how much people are content with staying under lockdown?
",52637,"The day after lockdown measures were implemented in the UK, YouGov conducted a poll of 2788 adults testing whether they supported or opposed the imposition of the measures.

They found that 76% of respondents strongly supported the measures, 17% somewhat supported them, and only a combined 4% opposed them in any way.

Just over two weeks later, on April 9th, they conducted another poll which asked respondents whether they would support or oppose lockdown restrictions being extended further than the initial three week period.

It found that while strength of support may have dropped slightly, the public was still overwhelmingly in favour of an extended lockdown, and that any drop in support was fairly negligible - combined opposition was found to be 5%, with combined support at 91%.

Indeed, YouGov has also found that at least in one part of the UK, respondents think that the lockdown doesn't go far enough - a poll published on April 10th that surveyed adults in Wales found that a majority (53%) thought that the lockdown measures should be tightened, with only 6% thinking that the measures should be relaxed.

I think we can conclude from this that although there may be a small amount of quarantine fatigue given the slight drop in strength of support for the lockdown measures between March 24th and April 9th, the public still remains overwhelmingly content with the measures at the moment, and there is evidence that at least one constituent country of the UK may support a tightening of the lockdown measures.

  Why than do Republicans continue to cut these programs?


For the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks.  That's where the money is.  

From Politifact, percent of federal spending:  


  
  25.3% Social Security
  28% Health (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.)
  16.2% Defense
  4% Veterans
  4% Food and Agriculture (including food stamps)
  4% Transportation
  3% Education
  2% International Affairs
  13% everything else (including welfare)
  


So between them Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other health spending make up 53% of the budget, and that percentage is growing.  

Even though Social Security and Medicare have specific taxes to fund them, those taxes don't actually fully fund the programs.  Both programs spent more than they received during the last recession.  Absent another recession, they might fund themselves through 2021.  The trust funds would be depleted entirely around 2034.  

Medicaid does not have its own taxes, so it is always paid out of the general fund.  

By contrast, Defense, Veterans, and International Affairs are only 22%, less than either Social Security or health alone.  And Republicans tend to be of the opinion that Defense is underfunded.  

The other alternative is to increase taxes, and the Republicans are against increasing taxes.  Since spending is projected to grow, to keep the deficit constant, they have to ""cut"" spending.  Of course, in reality, spending on Social Security and Medicare will continue to rise regardless.  The ""cuts"" are really only slowing the rate of growth from its current projected amount.  

Well, there is one other alternative.  They could increase the retirement age.  That both increases tax revenues from people working longer and decreases spending.  And it does so without increasing the tax rate.  That's essentially what the last bipartisan deficit commission recommended before Barack Obama rejected it.  


  Do they want all three of these programs eliminated completely? 


Perhaps some do, but most want the programs to be self-funded out of the existing set-aside money.  There is currently no one recommending an absolute drop in spending in either Social Security or Medicare.  Both will increase every year under any plan actually proposed in Congress.

9166,52643,How does libertarianism handle contagious diseases or pandemics?,"In libertarianism, each person is responsible for their own health.  Nobody is forced to take health insurance, and a hospital is not obliged to provide care to an individual who cannot pay for the bill (either by themselves, via insurance, or hoping for donations).  If you break your leg and can't pay for treatment, you don't get treatment.

How does the inherently individualistic libertarianism deal with the inherently collective threat of a contagious disease, which may become an epidemic?  If a sick individual is not treated, they may infect hundreds of others.  Quarantining the sick individual against their will goes against individual freedom.  In theory one could argue they may be liable for the medical costs of everyone they infect, but that is not helpful when people don't know who infected them and the infected individual can't afford treatment for hundreds of others.

Most countries deal with this threat by collectively paying for healthcare and drastically reducing the freedom of infected individuals, effectively putting them under house arrest or forcing them into hospital against their will.  Even the freedom of many healthy people is substantially reduced.  What alternatives does libertarianism propose to this, if any?
",52654,"While I haven't found a reference discussing the libertarian approach to pandemics more generally, I did find one about vaccines, which should be relevant enough, because it's another, related ""collective action problem"":


  Libertarianism and collective action: is there a libertarian case for mandatory vaccination?
  
  In his paper ‘A libertarian case for mandatory vaccination’, Jason Brennan argues that even libertarians, who are very averse to coercive measures, should support mandatory vaccination to combat the harmful disease outbreaks that can be caused by non-vaccination. He argues that libertarians should accept the clean hands principle, which would justify mandatory vaccination. The principle states that there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to participate in collectively harmful activities. Once libertarians accept the principle, they will be compelled to support mandatory vaccination. In my paper, I argue that the cases Brennan uses to justify this principle are disanalogous to the case of non-vaccination and that they are not compelling to libertarians. The cases Brennan offers can be explained by a libertarian using the individual sufficiency principle: which states that if an individual’s action is sufficient to cause harm, then there is a (sometimes enforceable) moral obligation not to carry out that action. I argue that this principle is more appropriate to Brennan’s examples, and more appealing to the libertarian, than the clean hands principle. In order to get libertarians to accept the clean hands principle, I present a modified version of one of Brennan’s cases that is analogous to the case of non-vaccination. Using this case, I argue that whether the clean hands principle will justify mandatory vaccination is dependent on whether the herd immunity rate in a given population is approaching a threshold after which a collective risk of harm will be imposed onto others.


So, one could say ""libertarians disagree"" [on the exact approach] to such matters based on that discussion. (And it would not be the only thing they disagree about.)

Actually, there is an article in the Telegraph that even says:


  How can libertarians ever support mandatory quarantine and nationwide lockdowns? 
  
  Quite easily, as it happens. I can’t speak for all libertarians (who can?) but I see libertarianism as applied economics. The government should leave businesses alone unless there are demonstrable market failures and it should leave people alone unless they are doing direct harm to others.
  
  In case it is not obvious, infecting somebody with a potentially fatal virus counts as direct harm to others....


I haven't read the rest, but I'm guessing he's going to argue from externalities viewpoint... which according to other libertarians (Ryan Bourne of Cato in this case) is rapid descent on the slippery slope:


  The classic recommended government remedy for this problem is to try to calculate the marginal external costs or benefits associated with a given activity (beyond the private costs or benefits) and implement taxes or subsidies so these externalities are priced in when consumption or production decisions are made. Joseph Stiglitz’s Nobel lecture is a good description of this policy solution.
  
  Given the pervasiveness of externalities, applying this logic consistently and universally would result in an extremely intrusive government.  [...]
  
  The logic of banning or adopting prohibitively high sin taxes, in contrast, is that the optimal consumption level of anything with external costs is zero. This is an absurd principle, albeit one that is regularly espoused. It is common, for example, to hear commentators and policymakers advocate for a zero-carbon economy. The UK government’s recent announcement that it plans to ban all gas and diesel vehicles by the year 2040 is an example of a policy that will almost certainly impose net social costs on society.


So yeah, from this latter ""more"" libertarian viewpoint, how do you account for the fact that infecting others is only a probability, not a certainty?

As an intermission, it would be interesting if the ""father"" of ""paleolibertarianism"" had something concrete to say on this ([the probability] of infection [of others]), but insofar I wasn't able to find out that, but only some imperfect analogies that he made:


  Probably the most widely accepted doctrine within libertarianism is the “nonaggression” principle, which Rothbard uses as the central theme of his book. The “nonaggression” principle states that “no man or group of men may aggress against the person or
  property of anyone else” (27). Thus, slavery was considered to be intrinsically evil because it
  violated property rights, or the right of a person to be secure in themselves. Yelling “Fire!” in a
  crowded theater, Rothbard argues, should not be restricted because free speech is only a relative
  right; rather, it is criminal because it violates the private property rights of others in the theater
  (52). Essentially, he ascribes to the belief that individuals have an absolute right to be secure in
  their persons and goes on to apply it to numerous other aspects of life. Whether it be education,
  roads, courts, foreign policy, or critiquing the ever-popular Keynesian theory of economics,
  Rothbard consistently believes that the rights of the individual are incontrovertible. His beliefs
  are best summed up as follows:
  
  
    And, indeed, what is the State anyway but organized banditry? What is taxation but theft
    on a gigantic, unchecked, scale? What is war but mass murder on a scale impossible by
    private police forces? What is conscription but mass enslavement? Can anyone envision a private police force getting away with a tiny fraction of what States get away with, and
    do habitually, year after year, century after century? (293-294)
  
  
  This argument continues to be the bedrock of radical libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, as it
  provides a consistent philosophy that can be applied across all aspects of life. Moderate
  libertarian thinkers tend to diverge from Rothbard, however, on the issue of how to implement
  these ideals. Some, like Rothbard, want sweeping change and scoff at others who argue for
  gradualism. Others, however, realize that government is needed in some limited capacity to
  retain order and that the free market has limits.


Actually Lew Rockwell interprets Rothbard for us in the present context:


  The fundamental rule for deciding whether anyone, including the government, is justified in using force to make us do something we don’t want to do is the nonaggression principle (NAP). As Murray put in in “War, Peace, and the State,” “No one may threaten or commit violence (‘aggress’) against another man’s person or property. Violence may be employed only against the man who commits such violence; that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another. In short, no violence may be employed against a nonaggressor.”
  
  You might at first think that you can use the NAP to justify forced quarantines against the coronavirus. Suppose someone had a deadly disease that would always spread to others if he came in contact with them. Probably the person would want to isolate himself and not infect others, but if he refused, wouldn’t the people in danger be justified in isolating him? He is a threat to others, even if he doesn’t intend to harm them. 
  
  Thinking about this case can lead us astray, and here is where Murray can help us most. In his great book The Ethics of Liberty, he says, “It is important to insist, however, that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct, in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act. Any remote or indirect criterion—any ‘risk’ or ‘threat’—is simply an excuse for invasive action by the supposed ‘defender’ against the alleged ‘threat.’” Murray hammers home the point later in the book. He says, “Once one can use force against someone because of his ‘risky’ activities, the sky is the limit, and there is virtually no limit to aggression against the rights of others. Once permit someone’s ‘fear’ of the ‘risky’ activities of others to lead to coercive action, then any tyranny becomes justified.”
  
  When we apply what Murray says to the coronavirus situation, we can answer our question about forced quarantines. People are not threatening others with immediate death by contagion. Rather, if you have the disease, you might pass it on to others. Or you might not. What happens if someone gets the disease is also uncertain.


Bourne (whom one might peg in the less ""paleo"" camp) also comments on the Covid-19 issue as well (on Apr 6):


  the longer lockdowns go on, the more the income losses for businesses and households turn into bankruptcies and defaults, risking a depression. So economists recognise that the costs and benefits of policy will change over time. They will look for ways of maintaining low health risks but at lower economic and social cost than crude shutdowns, recognising this balance changes as the pandemic evolves.
  
  Indeed, once the transmission rate has been brought down and more people recover from the virus, the calculations could change drastically. If I were one of the last 50 people in the whole country to have not yet been infected, I would not expect a destructive national lockdown to protect me. So, clearly, there comes a point when it’s better to relax things from an economic welfare perspective. That could come much sooner than we think.


Interestingly, it still considers a/the notion of welfare to society as a whole as relevant... but in view of how much [herd] immunity there is... which  actually is quite to the similar argument from the opening quote I gave in this answer. 

And it's easy to get sucked into the myriad variation of responses to Covid-19 of US libertarian writers/personalities/politicians (thus make this answer way too long), but I'll mention here anyway that Ron Paul (who ran for president on a Libertarian Party ticket at one point), has called (April 10) for Fauci to be fired because (according to Paul) Fauci infringed on American liberties by overestimating the number of potential deaths from Covid-19.


  ""[...] they made these dire predictions so that they could go ahead and destroy peoples’ civil liberties and spend a lot of money and make up an excuse on why the stock market actually went down — all kinds of things by having this coronavirus event blown way out of proportion,” Mr. Paul said. “He should be fired,” Mr. Paul said about Dr. Fauci. [...]


Personality polemics aside, it seems that in most libertarian discourse the probability of infection (and death) needs to be considered, so it's not too different from how others approach the matter, but perhaps the probability is (subjectively?) ""tuned down"" at least in some US libertarian discourse. However, the most hardcore/paleo libertarians seem to reject that quantines could ever be justified.
",Reasonable,"
First of all, IMHO this question can't be answered objectively, because no court has of yet ruled on whether the practice is legal. 

State court didn't hear any arguments on the topic, since the lawsuit filed by Pontiac had a radically different set of arguments.

Federal circuit court basically threw the issue BACK to the state saying ""we wash our hands off this"", in the best tradition of political actors going back to Pontius Pilate :)





Second of all, House people are officially claiming that no laws or rules were violated (whether they are correct or not is, again, a question that a court has NOT yet answered).

The meat of the issue is, distilled, as follows:


MI state constitution allows some bills to be passed in the Legislature as ""immediate effect"" (I won't bother with the links or quotes - see CJR link below or lawsuit link above for details)
This means the bill takes effect at passage, instead of 90 days later
This requires 2/3ds votes (super-majority) of both houses
The bills were being passed by a so-called ""rising vote"" voting (basically, the speaker guesses how many people voted ""yay"" and that's all she wrote), as opposed to roll call where every member's vote is recorded.
Minority may request a vote to be roll call...
BUTE, apparently, there seems to be some sort of technicality with how the roll call can be requested that basically allows majority to ignore the minority's request (minority must be called on to request... and majority doesn't have to call on them). Gotta LOVE politics.








Third of all, while Maddow tried to make it like some nefarious evil totalitarian power grab by Republicans (even throwing out stats like 90%+ of bills passed that way by Republicans)... subsequent second looks reveals that Democrats... did exactly the same thing. 


  Of the 761 bills passed when the Democrats had control of the House, 744 had “immediate effect.” (quoted by GOP press secretary, but confirmed by Columbia Journalism Review - not exactly a hotbed of conservatism).



For anyone who wants an in-depth and somewhat balanced look at the story, CJR's article seems to be a good starting point (http://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/maddow_michigan.php?page=all&amp;print=true)

If you pull a bike that hasn't been used for ten years from a shed, many things could be seized but even then seizing of the seat tube is far from guaranteed.

Firstly, it depends on your idea of ""old""   For some users thats any phone over five minutes is old, and for others old means a flip phone from the 90s.

Assuming you have an android-based or ios-based phone that works and has a decent battery life then you're pretty much set.  Both will run the Strava application, which looks something like this:



As @dancek says, the home screen is not configurable, so you will only see average speed for the whole ride, and instant heart rate/cadence rate if you have the sensors.   Time and Distance are counters



This is the screen that shows up when you stop.  The map with track at the top can be displayed full-screen while riding, and if you have planned a route the track is overlaid on the map as well.

Later analysis can be done on the info - here's the link for that ride:
https://www.strava.com/activities/681005599/analysis
Note I had a HRM but no cadence sensor.



This is the RUN view if you're into that kinda sport.

If you have an applewatch there's a thing for that, but I have no experience of this.   It looks like this:





Both of those screenshots show heartrate.   A phone can't do that alone - you need a heartrate sensor.  Phones with ANT+ radios are better than bluetooth sensors because the batteries last for 4-6 months, whereas bluetooth sensors are a much shorter runtime.   Also note, that phones with a ""pulse meter"" are useless for this purpose.





There are ant+ cadence sensors too - often a little box that straps onto a chainstay, and a small magnet on the end of a crankarm that passes near the sensor.



If you want to see your phone while riding that gets messier.  Personally I keep my phone in my pocket with the screen off.

Otherwise you'll need a handlebar mount, or a top tube bag, or both.  Its a good idea to bring a USB battery pack and cable for your phone, because a phone that runs for a day of normal use might only get 2-4 hours of riding time before its flat.

Right-angle USB cables can help organise things too.

This frame is about 10 years old (the model was sold for a few years). There is a chance that there's a crack in the carbon fiber, which would be cause for concern. There are services that will perform non-destructive testing, and there are ways to perform inspections at home with somewhat less reliability, but that would be my first concern.
It looks like the bottom bracket is intact. If the bearings turn smoothly, keep them. If not, you'll want to replace them, which would probably be the most complex part of your build. It looks like this bike takes a PF86 bottom bracket (there are numerous standards).
This bike was sold with a Shimano 105 group (possibly other groups as well). 105 has good performance and good value, so you won't go wrong with that. You'll obviously need caliper brakes, not disk, but that's about the only requirement from the options that will be available to you.
It looks like it has a front derailleur braze-on, so you'll need to make sure you get a compatible derailleur.
There are a lot of other options that will be matters of personal taste. Crankarm length, chainring tooth counts, cassette tooth counts, saddle, pedals, bar tape color, etc.

  A quick search, however, shows other colors available to purchase. Concerning ""to be seen"" bicycle lights, should they be avoided?


Yes, they should be avoided.

First, off-colors might not be legal in your area.

Second, and more importantly, no one will know what it is.  If a driver sees a flashing red taillight, or what looks like a normal white headlight, that driver is likely to identify you and your bicycle.  Something like a blue light is likely to evoke a, ""Huh?  What's that?""  Which means most drivers won't treat you like a known entity - something they need to avoid.  

And what do drivers (and cyclists, for that matter) do about things that don't evoke a familiar ""must avoid"" response?  You won't even register as being there.  Think about it - how many random items to you ride past all the time?  Do any of them really register at all?  Trees, mailboxes, plants, fence posts - they don't meet your brain's ""must avoid"" pattern, so you don't react to them at all.

You do not want to be cycling in the dark where you need lights so you're seen and safe, and then do any thing that makes it harder for others to identify you as a bicyclist.

Extending it to all travellers from China (since you don't want to rely on people self-reported itinerary) would be pure madness (and there are already cases reported in Japan and the US… so you might as well shut down international air travel entirely).

Why would they ban flights from all over China, when a majority of the cases are concentrated in a much, much smaller area? Remember that China is quite large. It would be akin to banning travel from all of Europe after an outbreak in a single city.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you consider that the virus has reached many places outside of China, why only ban flights from China rather than any country where there may have been any cases?
Unless all countries coordinate to completely isolate China (or whatever area is considered “infected”), then people will just travel via a third country, so the ban will be ineffective.


The difficult task of the health authorities is to balance reducing the risk that the virus spreads all over while not infringing on the freedoms to travel. They are constantly re-evaluating the risks based on the available info regarding number of cases, incubation period, ease of transmission, mortality rate, etc. It may be the case that this virus, even though new, is just no worse than the flu.

Remember that a travel ban not only could be a problem in terms of freedoms and rights of the affected people (try telling US citizens they can’t return home – the US government would be taken to court before you finished reading this sentence), but it also has a strong impact on the economy, which itself may have severe health repercussions.

",152928,"A cabin crewmember here.

This is different from airline to another, and country to another, but I can safely assume there are a lot of similarities when it comes to this, as most of the airlines get the instructions from local Civil Aviation Authorities and local health ministries, both authorities get the information from higher global organizations. 

The airline I work for supplied its fleet recently with a contagious disease kit, which shall be used by the cabin crew once there are signs of an infected passenger. This kit includes masks to be distributed once needed, a disinfectant liquid (the same as in hospitals) to clean surfaces around the sick passenger, gloves, etc. Also, my airline allowed its crewmembers to wear masks if they wish to on flights from/to certain destinations.

As I said, not sure if the same is being followed by other airlines. Regardless of that, you should inform the cabin crew right away, they are in this with you, they will know what to do. These days our mailboxes are being filled with health information and updates regarding this, and because we are exposed more than the average person, we really care about this.

Finally, what you should worry about is the infected people during the incubation period with no symptoms at all (this has been confirmed), they are as contagious with no way of knowing that. People with fever (a common symptom after the virus incubation period) will not be allowed to board. Therefore, it's advised that you follow basic prevention measures, such as washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, wear a mask (N-95 mask), etc.

This seems like a virus masterpiece, only the coming few days will let us know how serious this is.
",Accepted,"I would tell the flight attendant, and they will maybe ask for health screening at landing. 

Other than that, changing seat will not work, if the virus is already in the air, it might  (I AM NOT A DOCTOR) infect everyone.

From what I can see on the internet about it, is that there is nothing you can do about it other than not flying; most suggestions are to use disinfectant for your hands, cough in tissues (limit spraying around stuff); most references I've seen do not agree on wearing mask or not.

3038,153131,What are the current travel restrictions on individuals entering the United States from regions affected by Novel Coronavirus?,"This community wiki explains the current restrictions by the United States of America on the entry of individuals who may pose a risk of transmission of the Novel Coronavirus discovered recently in Wuhan City, Hubei, People's Republic of China.
",153132,"This answer currently lists nationwide entry restrictions imposed by the United States federal (national) government. A majority of states as well as counties, municipalities, towns, and cities have imposed entry bans or automatic quarantine-upon-entry orders as well as stay-at-home orders that may prevent your intended travel. This answer cannot index all of these orders, which have slight differences, technicalities, and effective dates that must be consulted to determine if your planned travel activity is allowed under state and local law. NBC News provides a basic overview as of April 5, 2020. Additionally, travelers should be aware that their home countries consulates in the US may not be operating normally.

Under the new rules, all flights carrying at least one non-crew passenger that has been physically present anywhere in mainland China, Iran, the Schengen Area, or the Common Travel Area (UK/Ireland) within the past 14 days must land at one of the following airports:


JFK - New York, NY
ORD - Chicago, IL
SFO - San Francisco, CA
SEA - Seattle/Tacoma, WA
HNL - Honolulu, HI
LAX - Los Angeles, CA
ATL - Atlanta, GA
IAD - Washington, DC


The following airports were added February 3, 2020:


EWR - Newark, NJ
DFW - Dallas/Fort Worth, TX
DTW - Detroit, MI


The following airports were added March 14, 2020:


BOS - Boston, MA
MIA - Miami, FL


Additionally, such individuals cannot travel to the US at all unless they meet one of these exceptions:


US citizens and nationals
lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
spouses of citizens or LPRs
parents of unmarried citizens/LPRs under 21
siblings of citizens/LPRs, both unmarried and under 21
children, foster children, and adoptees of citizens/LPRs
air and sea crew members
diplomats and foreign officials
those granted exceptions by high-level officials


Upon arrival, such excepted passengers will be subject to public health screenings by US Public Health Service personnel. At a press briefing on Jan. 31, 2020 (transcript), Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that individuals who have been to Hubei Province in the 14 days preceding entry will be sent to a 14-day quarantine, and individuals who have been to other parts of mainland China in the 14 days preceding entry will self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days at home. This is the first major federal quarantine action since the 1960s.

This action does not affect aliens (immigrants or nonimmigrants) already in the US. It does not cancel or revoke valid visas, though it temporarily prevents their use and may prevent the issuance of new visas in some cases.

Additionally, entering the US through land borders from Canada or Mexico is limited to ""essential travel"":


US citizens and permanent residents returning to the US
Travel for medical purposes
Travel to attend educational institutions
Travel to work in the US
Travel for emergency response and public health purposes
Lawful cross-border trade
Official government or diplomatic travel
US armed forces and their family returning to the US
Military-related travel


Questions and Answers

Does this include only mainland China, or other territories as well? The 14-day rule does not apply the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. It does apply to the disputed province of Tibet. It does not apply to Taiwan, the Republic of China, which is claimed by the People's Republic of China but is not functionally a part of that country.

Does this include British territories as well? The proclamation covering the UK excludes ""overseas territories outside of Europe"". This seems to mean that Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies are included, but other British territories are excluded.

Do the US-Canada and US-Mexico border restrictions apply to air travel? Not at this time.

When do these restrictions take effect?


For China: February 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST
For Iran: March 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST
For the Schengen Area: March 13, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.
For the Common Travel Area: March 16, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.
Land border restrictions: March 20, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.


Where are these regulations found? The Department of Homeland Security has a page on air travel restrictions, a fact sheet, and a list of news and updates. The CDC has a page on procedures for travelers from the affected countries.

The recent extension of restrictions to the Common Travel Area, consisting of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, was announced by US Vice President Pence at a press conference Saturday the 14th. Official regulations have yet to be promulgated.

Regulations on flights arriving in the US needing to be redirected to certain airports, published in the Federal Register:


For China: this document, with additional airports provided in this document
For Iran: this document
For the Schengen Area: this document with additional airports
For the UK and Ireland: this document


The Presidential Proclamations banning entry of certain sub-classes of these individuals:


For China: here
For Iran: here
For the Schengen Area: here
For the UK and Ireland: here


DHS has announcements for the US-Canada and US-Mexico land border restrictions, and the rules can be found in the Federal Register:


For US-Canada land border: this document
For US-Mexico land border: this document


How long will these restrictions last? The restrictions will remain in effect until further notice from the government. With respect to the entry ban specifically, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to advise the President at least every 15 days whether or not the ban should be changed or cancelled. The land border restrictions last until April 20, 11:59pm EDT.

Who made this decision, why, and what is there authority to do so? The Secretary of Homeland Security made the decision to impose new travel restrictions. The Secretary has the legal authority to designate the places at which flights inbound to the US may land for inspection. The Secretary decided that this measure was necessary to prevent serious harm to the national security.

The President has the authority to suspend the entry of aliens into the US as needed for national security. President Trump found that the federal government is incapable of monitoring all of the 14,000 daily travels between China and the US. Therefore, this rule is needed to protect the public health and safety of America.

The CDC has authority to enact quarantines under the Public Health Service Act.

What if I do not comply with these rules? If you lie to officials about your presence in China to avoid the regulations, you could face serious immigration consequences including expedited removal from the country and a permanent inadmissibility in the future. If you attempt to escape quarantine, the government may use lawful force to prevent you from doing so.
",Accepted,"I used to travel to Brittany every summer, and before having a child in school we'd usually go in late June or early July. You normally get summer weather, but avoid the hordes of children. It's a popular destination for British families so it's worth avoiding the British school holidays as well, and even the Dutch ones. The downsides are: the sea temperatures are still a little low, (not an issue if you're not going in the water); not everything is open. 

Just after the school holidays, in September, it's also quiet (maybe not the first week). Again some places are closed, such as restaurants taking a holiday, but the sea will be warmer. I've had good weather then too, but probably more rain. As you get into autumn the chance of rain increases, though the storms you worry about are fairly rare all year round (and dramatic if you find the right cliff-top spot to watch them).

If you have a flight ticket from/to other Chinese cities: your flight is still operating, unless if there is an announcement from the airline about your flight.

If you are arriving from China: you will be subject to further screening at the destination airport as the authorities want to ensure the virus will not enter the country. Please bear the extra process for safety reasons.

You can simply check your flight status from China Southern Airlines too by putting your Booking Number or ticket number.

3184,153445,KLM canceled a flight from China back to Europe that we had already requested a refund for. Are we entitled to compensation or just refund?,"Due to the coronavirus KLM canceled all flights from China about a week ago. Naturally we are entitled to a full refund. According to European Union air passenger rights, passengers are also entitled to up to €600 Of compensation in the case of a canceled flight. However, we requested a cancellation of our tickets five days before they announced the cancellation of our flight but after it became public that China closed down Wuhan with the risk of other cities. So we wanted to leave as early as we could. KLM had given notice that they offer rebookings and cancellations at that time. 

Are we therefore also entitled to a 600€ refund Or would we have had to first give KLM the chance to offer us an earlier flight before booking a flight with another airline and canceling theirs? Or should we have waited 5 days until they cancelled the flight to be entitled to receive both the refund + compensation?

So in short, what does the compensation depend on? Also, does the corona virus qualify for the airline to waive the compensation penalty because it’s an “extraordinary circumstance” in the legal sense?

Edit: the cancellation &amp; approval of the refund claim of my ticket came into effect yesterday, 5 days after the flight would have taken place. We received no confirmation of cancellation neither for our specific request nor any warning of the airline itself that the flight was cancelled in general. This suggests that they A cancelled our tickets and therefore B didn’t consider us a passenger anymore at the time of cancellation. Still, it’s odd that they never gave us confirmation of the ticket cancellation. Just a “pending approval for refund request” state. 
",153453,"The airline did NOT cancel your flight.  They cancelled a flight that you were not booked on at the time of the cancellation.  It is as simple as this.  You were not booked on the flight, so you are due no compensation.

IF you had not already canceled your tickets, and you were still booked on the flight at the time of the cancellation, then you might have been due compensation under EU261, but it's very likely that the airline would consider an epidemic to be ""extraordinary circumstances"" which removes the need for the airline to provide compensation.

Addition to address the update to the question :
Simplistically speaking, airline bookings have two parts - a ""reservation"" which covers the booking on specific flight segments on specific days, and a ""ticket"" which basically shows that you have paid for those flights.  When you book a flight, first a reservation is created, then you pay, and then a ticket is issued.

When you cancel flights, the reservation of those flights is cancelled.  At that point, you are no longer booked on those flights, although you still potentially hold a ticket.  This will happen immediately that you ask for the flights to be cancelled, as the airline wants to be able to free up the seats so they can sell them to someone else.  No refund will be made as a part of cancelling a reservation.

At this point, you hold a ticket that states you've paid $X for, but which contains no flight segments as they have been cancelled.  Depending on the airline, the actual ticket you purchased, and any special conditions the airline might allow (such as allowing refunds during an event like an epidemic even if the ticket doesn't normally allow refunds), the value on that ticket might be lost entirely, might be only able to be used to book a future flight, or might allow a refund.

In order to actually get the refund, whoever issued the ticket (which might be the airline you were flying, another airline, or a travel agency) will need to cancel it and process the refund back to you.  This is a separate step in the process, and it could happen hours, days, or even months after the reservation was cancelled.

However none of that changes the fact that once the reservation has been updated, you were no longer booked on that flight, and thus no longer due compensation.
",Accepted,"For a schedule change in advance it is always the ticketing carrier (in this case, Emirates) that is responsible for rebooking you after the change.

In a perfect world this would be handled automatically, but when multiple airlines are involved it generally doesn't - especially when those airlines are not part of the same alliance (Emirates is NOT OneWorld, despite your questions heading).  I would suggest reaching out to whoever you purchased your ticket from (either Emirates or the travel agent) and asking them to arrange an alternative. It is possible they will contact you, but the earlier you arrange the alternative the better the options may be.

Depending on how much notice you were given of this change and how much you need to change your arrival time, you may be able to claim compensation under EU261.

",Accepted,"As long as you travel within the EU (which for now still includes the UK), customs are not involved, the only thing they may check (and that's very very rare) are things that are actually illegal (drugs...) or where there are significant tax differences (cigarettes for instance). They will definitely not care about a laptop, accessories, or a graphics card.

If you enter or exit the EU (or travel between non-EU countries), in theory, they could force you to pay tax and duty on everything you carry beyond your personal allowance (usually around a few hundred euros), and you could then reclaim those when exiting again. In theory, you should use an ATA Carnet to avoid paying tax and duty.

In practice, in most countries (there are exceptions), they really don't care about all the stuff they know you'll bring back home when you leave. What is an issue to them is anything that will remain in the country. If your laptop, accessories, graphics card and whatnot look like you actually use them, they probably won't bat an eyelid. It would be different if you had a brand new laptop still in original shrinkwrapped packaging.

I think you confused security checks and customs in your question, but if it was indeed customs and not security that asked you to turn your laptop on, it was more probably to check that it was actually used (i.e. not waking up to the initial setup screens, but with an account created, applications installed, files present...).

As long as you can show them what you use the card for, I don't quite anticipate an issue.

If you really want to be on the safe side, get an ATA Carnet. But that's a bit cumbersome as it needs to have details of each trip, you often need to show the hardware to customs in your own country before and/or after leaving, you need lots of stamps, it's only valid for specific types of activities, etc. This is usually done only for hardware with prices in the thousands and more.

I will take my medication with me etc. I also look quite well.

I have a worry though. Can airport metal detectors/x-rays in the UK or in any airport detect temperature? If so and they want to pull me over for a check I will allow more time for airport security. 

Also, do you think they might have to test/quarantine me for coronavirus as the symptoms according to the NHS are:


  
  a cough
  a high temperature
  shortness of breath

On a far simpler level the same kind of non-contact technology is also being used  in handheld thermometers.

At the moment this is primarily targeted at travellers from the highest-risk areas (i.e. mainland China).

",Accepted,"Old City Hall Station was the very first station on the once on the original New York Subway System. It was built under City Hall. Due to age and other factors, including the proximity to the newer Brooklyn Bridge station, it was put out of commission in 1945.

The tours take about two hours, and start at the new Brooklyn Bridge station, which is approximately 600 feet away.

There are some strict rules you must follow, including:


  To be admitted to these restricted sites, participants must provide a copy of a government-issued ID for a background check, and must sign a release immediately after purchasing tickets. If you do not submit your signed release form and copy of a government-issued photo ID by the stated deadline you will not be permitted on the tour and you will not receive a refund.


The tours are sold out as soon as the tickets go on sale, usually within the first hour!

You usually need to wait until a designated time in order to get your tickets, which are released in blocks. Members receive an email newsletter three times a year, announcing the release of tickets for the coming few months. May through August tours become available in April.

3536,154396,Is traveling to Italy safe during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"We're traveling to Roma this Monday and we're kinda scared with what is happening in the North of Italy with the coronavirus.

A lot of news on the internet say that it's not advised but I feel like they're making a big deal of it and there's nothing to worry

Should we stay or can we travel there safely?
",154398,"The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the US government's public health agency, currently gives the following advice about travel to Italy:


  Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel—Widespread Community Transmission
  
  CDC recommends that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Italy. There is limited access to adequate medical care in affected areas.  ... If you must travel:
  
  
  Avoid contact with sick people.
  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
  Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%–95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.
  
  
  It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.
  Supplies of hand sanitizer, tissues, and other hygiene products may be limited, so consider bringing them with you.
  
  Pay attention to your health during travel and for 14 days after you leave.
  


It is probably advisable to postpone travel to Italy at this time.

Note that this advice is comparable to the ""Level 3"" advice for China and South Korea.  For those countries, the CDC recommends that everyone avoid all nonessential travel.
",Accepted,"Partial answer for the Israeli side of things:

I don't use guns myself, but I consulted The AirSoft factory, a BB-gun/air-gun store in Israel. They told me the following:

You need an official approval from the ministry for the economy to take an air-gun out of Israel. To do so, you contact them, give them the item's serial number (and probably more details), and they contact the customs at the airport to let you through when you get there. I've been told that at the minimum this takes 2 weeks - and even that if you're willing to pester them every day, otherwise it'll be longer. Also I'm not sure whether or not you'll need a written approval from them. I mean, I was told you won't, but I wouldn't trust that. Israel is rather uptight about security.

When I log in to the app and hit cancel, the credit shown is the exact amount I paid for the ticket - $953. Within the credit box, it says ""change fees may apply,"" but doesn't show any sort of deduction. I've read online they can charge up to $400 in change fees.

I'm scared to hit the confirmation button. Will I get back a full credit of $953? Thanks!
",154433,"United Airlines uses a ""New Money"" concept for change fees.

Basically this means that you can cancel your flight at this time and receive a $953 credit voucher.  However in order to use that voucher at a later stage you will need to pay $400 ""new money"" (ie, the $400 can't come out of the voucher value), and then you'll be able to use the full $953 value of the credit.

Depending on when the trip is, you may want to wait until it's a little closer to the date to see if they add Rome to their waiver list for areas affected by the Coronavirus. If they do that you will likely be able to (at least) avoid paying the change fee.  The refund amount/change fee won't change over time, so as long as you cancel at least a day or two before the flight there's no reason not to wait.

There's nothing that says you should be on the same flight as originally promised. This is true for every airline. If you are delayed there might be some compensation but that's it. There's no special compensation for being delayed by re-routing compared to the flight just being late.

",154585,"From what I can find of official information, the Czech Republic has suspended the processing of visa applications and issuance of visa at the embassy in Beijing and the consulates in China (Shanghai, Chengdu) and Hong Kong. It is worth to notice that this restriction affects also non-chinese residents of China, who are now also not able to apply for a visa.

Some media have indeed reported that the visa ban applies to all Chinese citizens, but there is no official information supporting that and I believe these reports to be mistakes. It seems very well possible for Chinese citizens who are resident outside China to get a Czech visa from the consulates at their place of residence and there seem to be no ban for residents of China to enter the Czech Republic if they are already in posession of a visa.

Unless the Czech Republic is the main destination in the Schengen area, it should also still be possible for Chinese residents to obtain a Schengen visa from other consulates and then use that visa for travel to the Czech Republic. It will probably have little impact on actual travel patterns for a single Schengen country to impose restrictions as have been done here.

  How should I document my things, both used (personal effects) belonging to my wife and myself, and our new things to meet CBP requirements?


Make an itemized list of everything that will be remaining in the US, along with its value.  Bring that with you when you travel, and present it with your customs declaration at the passport control desk.  Don't use an automated passport control kiosk if you can avoid it.

The way it's supposed to work is that you tell them about everything that's remaining in the US, and they tell you whether you have to pay duty.


  will CBP allow [my wife's] wedding clothes to still be considered my personal effects if she’s not there?


I think not.  The definition of personal effects includes the phrase ""articles intended and appropriate for the personal use of the nonresident while traveling.""


  Should I carry some evidence of our marriage?


It shouldn't be necessary.  It's seriously unlikely that a customs officer would challenge your ownership of the dress.  But it's possible, of course, and evidence of your marriage can't hurt.  A copy of your marriage certificate would surely be sufficient.

I'd say you should not confront the authors of that abuse (to avoid getting into the physical harm part below). Walk away and report it to the police.

",154653,"I think the myth here is that an older aircraft isn't safer because of wear and tear. That's not really true due to maintenance requirements. If you want to, you could fly in a Douglas DC-3 (1930s aircraft) today if you had enough time and money to find the operator. Any aircraft can be operated if it is still maintained.

The reason aircraft get retired from commercial airlines is generally they become expensive to maintain, not because they stopped being airworthy. Airlines don't buy one airplane, they buy a fleet, which includes the maintenance portion. The larger picture there is you need


Trained pilots
Mechanics to repair them
Available parts


It's #3 that will eventually drive an aircraft out of general use. Delta, which flies the MD-80/88/90 series, is set to retire the aircraft in 2022.


  Delta will remove the MD-90 two-years earlier than previous plans to “realize fleet simplification benefits,” said Jacobson during the airline’s second quarter earnings call on July 11. The airline will replace the aircraft with ones from its current orderbook, which includes 77 Airbus A220s(sic, likely A320) and 144 Airbus A321s and A321neos, he added.
  
  The early retirement of some MD-90s was understood to be to support the in-service fleet, with parts from the removed aircraft available to support operational aircraft.


In other words, Delta cannibalized some of its fleet for parts, and may be actively doing so with its rolling retirement. McDonnell-Douglass (who made the planes) is now owned by Boeing, and production of the MD-90 ceased in 2000. These planes can still be flown after Delta retires them, but Delta will have a hard time (i.e. expensive) sourcing new parts, which makes less sense for an active carrier airline operating thousands of aircraft around the world. Other aircraft of similar size are in production and their parts are more plentiful.

The planes will be sold to secondary carriers. You might have seen one in the news recently, when the US government chartered a flight with Kalitta Air (likely operating a 747-400) to evacuate US citizens exposed to the coronavirus. These companies operate smaller fleets and, since they get cheaper used aircraft, the increased cost of finding parts will be offset.

TL;DR

The Boeing 777 is still in production. It is as safe as any aircraft in commercial airline use, regardless of age.
",Accepted,"Yes good maintenance practices and regular overhauls by the aircrafts operator reduce the chances of an accident but in my opinion the chances of a component failure do to metal fatigue increases with the age of the aircraft, This is because every time an aircraft is pressurised, lands and takes off significant forces act on all the structural components. Unless the aircraft is completely dismantled, NDT'd (non distructive testing) some small stress fractures can go undescovered.
Also newer aircraft have better, stronger and more resilient materials of manufacture.
Therefore you are more likely to have an incident on an older aircraft compared to a newer aircraft.

",154694,"In February, I flew into Singapore through Seoul, and back the same way to Toronto. Singapore had a jump in cases just as we arrived; Seoul's jump was happening while we were in Singapore. Here is what we did:


hand washing pretty much every chance we got. (I say pretty much because if you walk a long way in an airport you will walk past multiple bathrooms; we didn't go in to each and every one and have a wash.) But we did sometimes go and wash even though we didn't need to use the bathroom. For example, every time we returned to our hotel room after being out.
hand sanitizer after handling money, before eating, or when sitting waiting
use sanitizing wipes to clean the airplane screen and trays immediately on getting to the seats. I should have done the seatbelt and arm rests too and will on my next trip.
try to pay by credit card, using contactless, and holding my own card instead of handing it to someone to tap for me, whenever possible. Avoid cash -- it really is filthy
don't touch handrails and other ""public"" surfaces unless you actually need them for support. Keep your hands to yourself as much as you can. In Singapore there was a lot of wiping going on, but in other places I have not seen that
really try to touch your face less. It's hard, you just need to watch videos of people telling you not to touch their face while people behind them touch their faces, and then moments later the speaker does too. It's hard. That's why all the handwashing and hand sanitizing is important
if you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or your elbow to confine it, so as to cause less distress to those around you and lower overall stress - to do this, you'll need a loose tissue in your pocket that you can grab quickly. If there's no nearby garbage, you'll need another pocket you can designate for dirty tissues. When you see a garbage, empty the dirty pocket and sanitize your hands to lessen the chance you're passing anything along.
monitor your temperature. In Singapore this was done for me many times a day. On return home I checked my temperature twice a day or so for 14 days to be sure I was not running a fever.
tell the truth when you come home. Don't be that person who lies about where they have been. 


In addition, at least one friend has taken a laptop on vacation, not because she might need it during the vacation, but in case she was quarantined in her destination or on return before she could get to her home. 

There are enough cases in Ontario now that when I go to Toronto and ride the public transit, I'm going to take all these same precautions. This is really not just a travel issue any more.
",Accepted,"The shuttles to the car rental area are pretty roomy unless you get unlucky and several flights arrive more or less simultaneously, in which case you could wait for the next one.  They come around every few minutes at most.

There is quite a lot of seating, plus standing is possible.  There is also a luggage storage area on the shuttle where quite a large number of bags can be placed.

However, there is something called ""satisfactory departure"" which can be granted to VWP visitors who cannot leave within their 90 days of admission due to an emergency like hospitalization or natural disaster in the US, to allow them to stay for an additional period of at most 30 days. I am not sure whether a fear of returning to a country with some disease transmission will qualify.

The US has also sometimes granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for years to people in the US who are nationals of developing countries that have suffered a major disaster with long-term effect on the country's infrastructure like a major earthquake, civil war, or Ebola outbreak, etc. However, I highly doubt that they would do that for COVID-19, as it is a short-term problem that does not significantly damage the country's infrastructure, and has mostly been in relatively developed countries. Also, Republicans have been wary of granting TPS.

It's a legal connection, so if you don't make the flight, they will put you on the next one and put you up in a hotel if needed. 

In this case, it may be a good idea to check a bag. If you get snagged in security, the airline has the choice to wait or leave without you. However, they can't take your bag (for security reasons) without you being on board. So they would need to unload it first, which costs time and money.

As stated in a comment by @DJClayworth, the US does not provide emergency care free of charge. Charges do vary between hospitals, and US healthcare is the most expensive in the world.
Visitors contemplating extending their stay in the US because of worries about the extent of the epidemic in their country of residence should check that they have adequate insurance for the entire length of stay, starting from the date they arrived in the US.

Is the flight cancelled?

Currently, he does not know. He can (and should) check the flight status online (Swiss timetable and Lufthansa Flight Status).

As long as the flight isn't officially cancelled, it makes little sense to call or go to the airport - they can't tell you much. Also, it makes little sense to re-book if you don't know which flights are going to operate.

What happens if it is cancelled?

If the flight is cancelled, the airline will offer to re-book him on a different one: There are multiple flights from Athens to Zurich, but they could rebook him completely (e.g. going through Frankfurt on Lufthansa). If isn't happy with the new itinerary, they will usually offer other options. He could also get a refund, but it seems like he wants to travel.

If he booked it through a third party (e.g. Expedia), he'll have to go through them for any re-booking.

If the flight isn't cancelled, he should be at the airport early so that he can directly talk to the agents in case of a last-minute cancellation.

On their information page Swiss currently informs passengers that they can freely re-book all tickets bought before March 5th. (However, it seems like your BF wants to travel).

3685,154759,Airfare refunds for coronavirus,"Has anyone had success getting airlines to issue refunds, or at least extend the value of unused tickets, for upcoming travel that had been booked long before the COVID-19 outbreak?  

My question specifically concerns United Airlines and non-refundable tickets to destinations that are not otherwise covered by any explicit guidance.  I'd be interested in hearing about others though.

It seems like airlines are offering flexibility for new travel bookings but not ones made a while back.  And travel insurance will only cover you if your travel is individually impacted due to illness or quarantine.  
",154768,"Your question is very generic, so I answer in general:

In general if a government (or an airline) doesn't stop travellers or planes, you will have no direct refund. It means that both think that there is no danger.

So usually it is recommended to have a travel insurance (for important/expensive travel, like far away for holidays). On the other hand, also a travel insurance may not allow you to cancel: it depends on the kind of insurance you get: some (the more expensive) doesn't ask reasons, other are more restrictive (and again, if you are not in a risk category, and there is no recommendation from government) they will not refund you.

On the other hand, this is a special (and global) thing, so to get good news coverage, they may end to refund you. Cruise lines are starting this (also for old bookings), let's hope also the airlines will follow.

The reason about having such rules for new booking: they are trying to convince new people to book. Without such incentives, many passengers will not book (and after booking many will travel anyway), this will keep cashflow. Old booking: they have already paid, so if they do something, it is just to get good publicity.

Because the airlines will reduce flights, you may hope that they will effect your flight, so that you can cancel/rebook (or having credit for next flight).

  II. Ticket Handling Rules
  
  
  The tickets are valid for one year from the date of issuance. Any applicable tickets as defined above can be refunded free of charge within the validity period of one year as long as the refund is requested before the departure of the flight. We kindly ask the passengers to apply for refunds outside of peak periods.

To make better use of the transport capacity during the Spring Festival, we kindly ask the passengers to apply for refunds before the departure of the flight. If you have decided to cancel your trip, please cancel your check-in seat as soon as possible through the original check-in channels to avoid wasting the resources and to ensure the seat availability to other passengers who still need to travel.
  The rules are effective immediately and supersede the previous Notes on Free Refund for Air China Flight Tickets.

According to the link to the embassy you provided you will be denied entry to Jamaica. This will most likely already be executed by KLM staff in Frankfurt. This means you will be denied boarding in the first place.

The only exception would be if you are (also) a Jamaican citizen.
You did not mention when you are flying, so if your flight is only going to be in a few weeks or even days, the situation might have changed completely. Then you just have to wait and go an a day-by-day basis and see what the embassy has to say.

As per your suggestion that you could still only travel to Atlanta, I suggest you search for ""skipping one leg of a journey"" here on this site. This usually always turns out bad (especially for a possible return flight which will be cancelled by the airline). Since in the US you always have to check your bags again on an international transfer, you could get your bags at least and given the right Esta/Visa for the US you could leave the airport and wait two weeks there. Two weeks would be the minimum period you'd have to wait before being allowed entry into Jamaica. You would then have to buy a new ticket to Jamaica, of course and your return flight would have been cancelled and you would have to buy that one again, too.

With all this said, it might be best to call the airline (Delta in this case, since you booked with them) and see if they can give you a (full) refund.

This is, for them, a logistic problem. Will the plane needed be there on the 20th for your scheduled return flight?.

Having a reservation relatively soon after the 16th is a positive point for you. Somebody who would be casually traveling from island to island less so. 

Assume nobody is interested in keeping peaple stranded. It may not work out exactly as planned, but as seen in the recent past, everybody was able to return.

Keep in close contact with your travel agent and make sure you are available at short notice to leave. 

If you are not satisfied with this arraignment, you can make your own. But assume this may be difficult. 

Also make sure that your travel insurance covers this situation if you expect them to cover the costs of your private arrangements.

3756,154999,What to do after Air Canada cancelled flight home,"A friend of mine is currently in Cuba and was due to return to the UK on 2 April travelling Holguin> Montreal with Air Canada, and onwards to London Gatwick with BA (single PNR, booking made direct via the Air Canada website).

Yesterday she received an email cancelling her flight but without giving any alternative. Long-distance communication from Cuba can be difficult, so far she has been unable to contact the airline to find out if they will re-book her on an earlier flight.

I have tried to help her from the UK, but the ‘manage my booking’ option just directs me to a toll free number that doesn’t connect. I tried calling their Customer Services number in Canada but, unsurprisingly I suppose, could not get through.

FWIW, she is a UK citizen married to a Cuban citizen/resident but will need to try to extend her 60 day visitor visa (usually the maximum allowed) if she is trapped in Cuba. She is a 15 hour bus journey away from Havana and if possible needs to depart from Holguin. Only a few airlines fly into Holguin, the only realistic alternative would be Condor via Frankfurt, then Lufthansa to UK.

To date I don’t recall seeing many questions about Air Canada and flight cancellations. I am aware that they are offering a flexible change policy right now. 

My question is: 


has anyone else been in this situation with Air Canada since the COVID-19 emergency erupted? Given that her cancelled flight was more than 48 hours away, can we expect Air Canada to email her again in the next couple of days with information about an alternative flight?

As far as the embassy is concerned, this is called ""repatriation"": returning citizens to homeland.  At extremes, they'll send government aircraft*. But far more likely they'll just use their contacts within the airline** to get the flight you already paid for straightened out. 

In the event of a government-flown rescue like this, it is common for government X to give courtesy flights to government Y's citizens; so for instance the UK might have their citizens hitch a ride on a US State Dept. flight to Miami, rather than send a flight from the Cayman Islands and then on to (gosh, probably Miami). 





* For instance, America's State Dept. has the pull to get a military C-5 sent; some China evacuation was done by a Kalitta Air 747, under contract to the US military. However the State Dept. also has its own internal aircraft fleet also, including turboprops as large as Bombardier Dash-8's.

3757,155009,UK Standard Visitor Visa implications during travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19 outbreak?,"My wife (a Kazakh national) is visiting in the UK on a Standard Visitor Visa, staying with my family. She arrived on Feb 1st. Her original intention was to stay for approximately 3 months, until April 30th, and stated as such on her application form. She had been to the UK twice already, and had always departed in line with her intentions as originally stated during her previous applications. Her current visa expires in July.  

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Kazahkstan will institute a one-month travel ban from tonight, preventing flights into the country. I'm a little concerned about what should happen if the ban is extended beyond that. 

I understand that the Home Office generally frowns upon visitors who stay longer than their stated intentions, even if they do not overstay their visa lengths. But if the Kazakh travel ban prevents her from travelling back to her country until a date beyond April 30th, might this cause a problem in her future visa applications? Or is it a reasonable excuse, and provided she explains the extended duration of her previous stay during the future application, might it be okay? 

Edit: On that note, she applied for this UK visa from China (where we lived at the time). Obviously, returning to China at this point, while theoretically possible (though we'd have to apply for new Chinese visas; they expired in February, a fact that she readily disclosed in her application), is hardly desirable. This is a circumstance that we could hardly have predicted beforehand. Her Chinese visa was temporary and she acknowledged this fact during her application. Might the UK officials think ""well, you couldn't fly to Kazakhstan, sure, but why not go back to China? After all, you applied from there"" ? I must stress that she never stated during her application that she intended to go back to China; indeed our plan was always for her to fly to Kazakhstan around April 30th, the original envisaged date of departure. Am I overthinking this, and would the specific country that she'd go to after departing the UK be of no concern to them whatsoever?

From Chipata to Lusaka you're on the Great East Road, which is the main highway connecting Lusaka to all points east.

  ticket, the right to care ends. The same happens when the passenger chooses re-routing at
  a later date at the passenger's convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article
  8(1)(c)).
  
  The right to care subsists only as long as passengers have to wait for a rerouting at the
  earliest convenience (Article 5(1)(b) in conjunction with Article 8(1)(b)).
  
  The intention underlying the Regulation is that the needs of passengers waiting for their
  return flight or re-routing are adequately addressed. The extent of adequate care will have
  to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of passengers in the
  circumstances and the principle of proportionality (i.e.: according to the waiting time).
  The price paid for the ticket or the length of the inconvenience suffered should not
  interfere with the right to care (Interpretative Guidelines Point 4.3.2).
  
  According to the Regulation, the air carrier is obliged to fulfil the obligation of care even
  when the cancellation of a flight is caused by extraordinary circumstances, that is to say
  circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been
  taken.
  
  The Regulation contains nothing that recognises a separate category of 'particularly
  extraordinary' events, beyond the 'extraordinary circumstances' referred to in Article 5(3)
  of the Regulation. The air carrier is therefore not exempted from all of its obligations,
  including those under Article 9 of the Regulation, even during a long period. Passengers
  are especially vulnerable in such circumstances and events.10 In exceptional events, the
  intention of the Regulation is to ensure that adequate care is provided in particular to
  passengers waiting for re-routing under Article 8(1)(b) of the Regulation.

",Accepted,"I recall seeing Gayot Fow claim that this was possible, which one does not contradict lightly. On the other hand the ""conventional wisdom"" is that a Schengen consulate would probably refuse to examine a visa application from an Annex II national. And the Schengen rules I can find do not clearly seem to contemplate that possibility.

The rules context is quite different. A third-country national wishing to enter the UK needs to have either an ""entry clearance"" (applied for in advance) or ""leave to enter"" (granted by the immigration officer at the border). So having an entry clearance does, in principle, mean that you don't need to convince the IO to take the positive step of issuing a leave-to-enter, just that he should honor the entry clearance you already have.

In contrast the Schengen Borders Code states that all third-country nationals go through the same ""thorough check"", described in Article 8, subsection 3(a). Verification of a visa for Annex I nationals is in addition to that common procedure. At least as far as the EU legislation goes.

Neither does the Schengen Handbook for the processing of visa applications mention anything (in either direction) about visas for Annex II nationals.

This does not conclusively prove that there can't be an administrative practice of issuing visas to Annex II nationals who bother (and pay) to apply for one. But such a practice could well vary between member states. In particular, if you succeed in applying for a visa from one member state, and then enter the Schengen area through another member state, it might be that the border guards there would be confused rather than reassured if you present a visa.

What you could argue is that the ""we charge you automatic gratuities which you have to jump through multiple hoops to cancel"" was not part of the original terms in the cruise purchase. I've never seen it presented clearly while buying a cruise - especially if you buy it at 3rd party retailer like Costco travel. And this is an important term.

Those terms are introduced later, during the check-in procedure, as part of ""cruise contract"". However at this moment the cruise has been already paid, and you're not having an option to decline the contract and get the full refund. Thus what Carnival is essentially doing is coercing you into contract modification, adding new terms which were not disclosed during the purchase. And the terms itself are not very clear.

Carnival also knows that this practice is shady, considering how deep they hide it. Thus once they are served with lawsuit, they will likely try to settle it with you.

This is because check-in staff rely on the TIMATIC database to verify documentation, which says a passport, green card, emergency passport, transportation letter or (if flying from Canada) NEXUS card is required to enter the US by air.

(in addition, you cannot get a visa as a US citizen, and you state that your foreign passport would require one)

However, per TIMATIC, US citizens can fly to and enter Canada with only their naturalization certificate. From there you can cross into the US by land and, if need be, catch a domestic flight.

The parts I think will be of most interest to the most people are those concerning cancellations by the airline, cancellations by the passengers themselves and compensation for delays and cancellations.

Flight Cancellations by Airline

In the case of a flight cancellation by the airlines (no matter what the cause is), Article 5
obliges the operating air carrier to offer the passengers the choice among:

a) reimbursement (refund);

b) re-routing at the earliest opportunity, or

c) re-routing at a later date at the passenger's convenience.

The guidance also makes very clear that if an airline offers a voucher instead of the choice between refund or re-routing, this does not affect the passenger's right to opt for a refund.

Flight Cancellation by Passenger

In cases where a passenger cannot or no longer wants to travel, whether or not the passenger is refunded or re-routed depends on the ticket type as specified by the airline's terms and conditions.

Right to 261/2004 Compensation

In short...a passenger is not entitled to EU261 compensation  for to delays or cancellations related to the pandemic. The airline still has a duty of care to their passengers who are travelling, which you can read more about.

Our thoughts for why it would be good to go:


Avoid possible looting/rioting/violence
Emotional reasons (being with family, having more space)
Easier to keep distance from people with a much smaller population around you


Possible reasons to stay where we are:


Possibly spreading the virus (my wife has had a light cough for a few days, but no other symptoms)
Health organizations asking us to stay put (although we would remain inside once we got to the new place)
Maybe we're just overreacting and the chance of civil unrest right now is very low

You should also listen to the advice of medical professional about what is discouraged. Anything you do that increases contact increases the chance of spreading Covid-19 is going to make the overall situation worse - and most kinds of travel will result in increased contact.

In some countries the number of infected people is lower, or already going down, as in the first area that had been infected, but that is because of containment and isolation measures.
It is expected that a new or second wave will come, again leading to restrictions. And likely no country in the world will escape while accepting people to visit or move in.  

If you travel from the UK to somewhere else in the world, there is a huge risk of you spreading the virus. That will be for the for the next few months at least, but more likely for at least a year, or even a few years. (This is the negative view, but it is realistic.)

Yes.  It's also the hardest way.  It's the only way.

More seriously, there could be some sort of amnesty or other program offered to nonimmigrants in the US who are affected by the pandemic.  If that happens, it could save you a few hundred dollars.

But I wouldn't count on it.  I certainly haven't heard any mention of it, and the current administration is profoundly anti-immigrant, so it's unlikely to happen without political pressure.

In terms of risk analysis, the application fee will be well spent.

Applying for a fee waiver is going to make her look like someone with financial problems, which will have a negative impact on her application as well as future applications for admission to the US.  I would not do it.


  After filing I-539 should she wait for an approval to continue her stay? Or is the receipt good enough?


Once the application is filed, she can remain until it is refused, or, if it is granted, until the end of the period of extended stay that is granted.

Pdf form for Italy (parent page Trasferimento di denaro contante, in case link breaks)



In the Italian version there is this friendly reminder of the possible sanctions, to encourage travelers to fill the form correctly.  


  Sanctions
  
  In case of failure to produce the declaration or in case of incorrect or incomplete information, the person submitting the same declaration is punished with a sanction amounting to a minumum of €300 up to a maximum of 40% of the value of the transfer exceeding €10.000 (article 3 of Regulation 1889/2005/EC and article 9 of Legislative Decree n.195/2008) and the cash be subject to seizure (article 6 of Legislative Decree n.195/2008). Failure to indicate personal data of the person on whose behalf the transfer is made or the reporting of false data shall be punished - except where the act constitutes a more serious offence, by imprisonment from 6 months to a year and by a fine ranging from € 516,46 to € 5.164,57 (art. 5, c. 8 bis, of Decree Law 167/1990, transformed in Law 227/1990).


That law is probably what originated your misconceptions about Swiss Custom officers, while it is only an Italian matter. Also for small sums if you pay the fine on the spot you get a discount (to pay the higher amount between 200€ and 5% of the exceeding sum) and the remaining cash shall not be seized unless there are other issues.

I would advise making 2 copies of each and ask the Customs to confirm the second copy in case you don't receive some sort of confirmation directly.   

These confirmations should be retained since they may be helpful in the future to prove that you did everything correctly.

3833,155236,Booking.com not refunding my Disneyland Paris stay,"Back in January, I booked to stay in Hotel Disneyland Santa Fe in March (in Paris). Due to the effect Covid-19 has had in everyday life and travel, Disneyland Paris had to close including the hotels for guests who were not there at the time of the closing down decision. I contacted Booking.com 5 days before my stay at the Hotel and explained the situation and they said they would get back to me in 24 hours. 

In the meantime, I contacted the hotel and they said that I should only deal with Booking.com as it's their booking to manage. The hotels in Disneyland Paris also announced that for the visitors affected they would offer either a full refund or a chance to reschedule for a later date whilst keeping the same charge for the rooms as the ones in their original booking. 

Now Booking.com says that since the reservation wasn't cancelled beforehand and they're unable to cancel it after the arrival date has passed, they can only offer me half of the money back. I should note that on my initial phone call with them I wasn't told to cancel the booking or do anything for that matter, as they would have to investigate the best way to resolve this. 

The booking was made using my credit card, but since it was made in January, I'm now out of the period that I can ask them to step in and withdraw the money and return them back to my account. 

Is there anything that I can do at this point to make sure I get my money back for a travel that I was not allowed to make considering the hotel was not accepting guests and the French government was cancelling my Eurostar trains at the same time (Eurostar, by the way, has issued a full refund since my trains got cancelled).

I will send you the booking invitation through the Booking.com system &lt;= once again, airbnb has this but even there only after enquiring after a property, Booking.com very simply does not have such a feature. This person is talking nonsense, we will see why.
Booking.com will automatically provide the tenancy agreement. &lt;= the very reason Booking.com stops at 30 days is because in a lot of jurisdictions 30 days is where a short term becomes a tenancy and booking.com does not want to mess with tenancy agreements. Booking.com most assuredly will not provide a tenancy agreement! I have first booked an apartment with Booking.com close to five years ago and there's nothing even remotely close to a tenancy agreement in all those emails, I reviewed a few again.
If you don't like the property for any reason, Booking will refund your money on the same day. &lt;= Booking.com doesn't exactly work like that. As this blog post shows, the host sets the cancellation policy and up until very very recently the scammer was able to siphon the funds off as soon as the reservation becomes 90% non-refundable, otherwise on the guest’s check-in date. See for example here. Right now, because of the COVID-19 situation, they can only get their money one day past check in per this update but I somewhat suspect they are not 100% up-to-date. Also, do you want to convince Booking.com that the apartment simply doesn't exist within less than 24 hour before your money is gone? If Booking.com doesn't side with you then your only avenue is to sue them in a Dutch court of law.


Finally, if I needed to make a grim bet, I would put my money on this being nothing more than bait-and-switch and they don't want to use Booking.com: you agree to this, and after some hemming and hawing and probably a few juicy photos they come back complaining about some problems with booking.com listing and ask for a plain vanilla WU wire. By this time you are hopefully hooked enough to go ahead with it, if not, what's there to lose for them? You can even test it by agreeing and see what happens, just don't send money to them... 

And if you are wondering how people rent long term in a different country: they might have boots on the ground (company or friend) and if they don't then just do a short term rent much like it'd be a vacation and get a place once you are there. Easy as pie. I did so when I landed in Vancouver.

3834,155243,Air France cancellation policy seems to violate EU261,"Air France states that for COVID-19 related cancellations:


  ""... or complete the online form below to obtain a travel voucher. This voucher is valid for 1 year on all Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic flights. This voucher will be refundable after one year if it is not used.""


Source

That seems like a ploy to circumvent EU261 regulations which I believe require a full refund in cases of cancellations. Air France is offering sort of a refund but with one year delay built in. 

Background: we have an US&lt;->India ticket booked on Expedia with an Air France ticket. We obviously can't fly this and some legs have already been cancelled anyway. We like a full refund, not airline credit.

Question: What's the best strategy to approach this? We shouldn't really call Expedia until 72-hours before departure, Air France says ""call your travel agent"" and I'm worried that Expedia will simply say ""airline is offering credit: take it or leave it. EU261 is not our problem"". Does anyone have some experience with Air France cancellations recently?
",155245,"I would say that at least Air France is being fairly up front in light of the (probable) fact that their cash flow does not suffice for the refunds that they are obliged to provide.  If they hadn't come up with this voucher policy and instead decided to acknowledge their obligations up front, they would probably nonetheless drag their feet a year or more before actually giving you the money.

That said, the regulation does in fact specify reimbursement within seven days.  So you could pursue them if you want to.  Short of hiring a lawyer, the regulation provides that you can seek enforcement through the national enforcement body designated under Article 16(1).  A list of such bodies is found on the website of the European Commission.

3854,155244,What is Essential Travel?,"In response to the current pandemic, the government of Canada recently said to:


  Avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada


Other governments have made similar statements restricting travel.

So, if one is to avoid non-essential travel: What essential travel is allowed?

Below are some examples that came to mind but what are exactly determines if travel is in fact essential?

Things that come to mind:


Journalists going to where they want to investigate for a report.
Going to help isolated family members
Business meetings and factory visits, whether to establish policy or oversee measures that related to the COVID-19 or other task related to production.


Is any proper documentation needed to show that travel is essential? Or do we expect gate and border agents to evaluate on the spot based on your word?
",155258,"Some examples that I have seen in the media:


a healthcare worker who lives in Windsor, Canada and works in Detroit, USA. There are thousands of such people and they cross the border every day. They are doing so to deliver an essential service (healthcare) so their travel is essential
a truck driver pulling a load of food, medical supplies or other essential goods. While in theory the delivery company could have the truck handed off to a different driver at the border, more realistically the truck and driver will be allowed in as essential travel
a patient returning to their home city to keep an appointment for needed surgery. Most elective surgeries, dentist appointments and such are being cancelled, but a person could have been away just before their scheduled surgery
farm workers from Central America are going to be allowed in to Canada because our farms can't function without them


What is not essential?


tourism
business or work that does not serve an essential purpose (making a movie, looking for new restaurant locations to buy or rent in another city, negotiating a big purchase business-to-business of something non-essential like bathing suits or makeup)
people who feel they would be less likely to catch this if they went to their second home in the country
people who prefer the weather in Ontario to the weather in Alberta at this time of year


If I was going to do some essential travel I would bring whatever proof I could, and I would prepare for a significant wait while my explanation was evaluated. I am tempted to say, if you have to ask, it's not essential. I personally have cancelled a followup CAT scan and MRI scan required by a clinical study I am in. Everything's been stable for a while, so I'm not going to the big city. It doesn't feel essential to me. 

March 28th, the CBSA tweeted this image:



Keep in mind that in many Canadian provinces, non-essential workplaces are closed, so where this image says ""work"" it means ""essential work"".

Also, this applies only to people without symptoms. People with symptoms, whether citizens returning home, truck drivers pulling essential supplies, anyone will be refused or (more likely) taken into quarantine until they test negative. Also March 28th people with symptoms will be refused boarding on domestic flights and trains, regardless of the reason for travel.

3856,155259,Who is responsible for the refund policy on a code-share flight?,"During July 2019, I booked flight UA7938 for March 30 through United Airlines for my honeymoon. With everything involving Covid-19 happening, I'm trying to see if I can get a refund for the ticket or an extension on the ticket. My main issue is that I do not know who is responsible for a potential refund. United is the marketing airline and ANA is the operating airline.

United is waiving change fees for flights booked prior to March, which I can apply to my ticket online, but I would have to travel before July 2020. I don't know what kind of travel I can do before July and I do not want my money to go to waste. On the other hand, ANA has been issuing refunds for all international flights booked prior to March. Do I follow United's policies or can I follow ANA's? Has anyone had luck with similar situations?
",155274,"When you buy an airline ticket there are up to 3 separate airlines that can be involved for each leg of the flight.  These are common known as :


The ""Marketing Carrier"".  This is the airline who's flight number is on the ticket/itinerary.
The ""Operating Carrier"".  This is the airline who's aircraft will actually fly the flight.
The ""Ticketing Carrier"".  This is the airline that actually sold you the ticket.


(The ticketing carrier will be the same for all legs of the flight on the same ticket. The other two can vary from leg-to-leg)

In many cases, all 3 will be the same - you buy a ticket from airline XX, for flight XX123, which is flown by airline XX themselves.

In your case, all 3 are not the same.  UA7938 is marketed as a United Airlines flight (thus the UA flight number), but the operating carrier is ANA.  What we can't tell from the information you've provided is who the Ticketing Carrier is - and that's the one that actually matters here!

If you purchased your ticket directly from an Airline website, then you can be fairly sure that's the ticketing carrier.  If you purchased it from a travel agency, then it's a little more complex.  In general, if all flights on a ticket are for the same marketing airline (eg, all UAxxx flight numbers) then most likely the ticket was issued by that airline.

To be certain, you'll need to check the ticket itself. In your email confirmation (or on the relevant website for where you bought the ticket) you should find a ""ticket number"" which is generally around 13 numbers long.  The first 3 digits in this number show who the Ticketing Carrier is.  If this number is 016, then your ticket was issued by United Airlines.  If it's 205, ANA.  If it's 014, it's Air Canada.

Now, back to your original question. The policies that apply in a situation like this will be the policy of the TICKETING carrier.  That carrier might be influenced by the OPERATING or MARKETING carriers policies, but officially it is the ticketing carrier that you've paid for your ticket, and it's them that has your money up until the time that you actually take the flight.

In your case it's most likely that United is the ticket carrier so it would be their policies that apply - but you'll need to check the ticket number to be sure!

  Once you receive the booking invitation from Booking.com, you will have to choose your check-in date ( this would be the date that you
  would prefer to move in ) &amp; staying period ( minimum one month and
  maximum five years )
  After registration, you will have to pay £ 2,200 to Booking.com to get your reservation confirmed. The payment of £ 2,200 would be used
  as a 1 (one) month of rent + 1 (one) month security deposit. You can
  use it as the last month of rent or take it back at the end of your

  more extended period will enable you to have the contract for it and
  receive the invoice each month during the selected period.
  Your deposit will be held by Booking.com in their system until your check-in, after which will be put in a DPS as per law.

3914,156465,Are there alternatives for booking flights unavailable directly via the airline (but available from an Online Travel Agent?),"This year I had something happen to me twice, which I never witnessed before nor I thought possible: An airline has flights for the legs that I'd like to fly on, but if I try to book the whole trip, it only proposes me a more complex trip with an extra leg. In the meanwhile, the desired booking is possible on an OTA website.

I presume that this might be because OTAs have access to more inventory, but this seems weird. The two examples were:

London to Yekaterinburg: I flew with British Airways + S7. They are partner airlines and S7 can sell me the London-Moscow leg of the trip, but S7 was only offering me a more complex trip (something like: London - Berlin - Moscow - Yekaterinburg)

London to Longyearbyen: I booked a SAS trip with Layover in Oslo (cancelled due to Covid19), but the SAS website was only offering me trips like: London - Copenhagen - Oslo - Longyearbyen or London - Stockholm - Oslo -Longyearbyen 

In the above cases, I booked from an OTA, but I'd really prefer to avoid in the future (in one direction, my luggage couldn't be checked-in all the way through even if that went smoothly on the way back. I got multiple check-in codes for the same booking, and making changes is just overall much more painful if a travel agent is involved).

I just managed to find another example (again, for Longyearbyen: just an example, since I'm not currently planning of flying there in September):



As you can see, for the day only trips with 2 layover are offered.

But I checked on 4 different OTAs, and all of them are offering a booking with a single layover:


Expedia

Lucky2go





Lastminute





Gotogate




This seems even weirder, when you consider that the single legs are actually available for purchase on SAS itself:





But somehow, SAS doesn't allow me to purchase this trip directly with them.

How common is this? Are there other solutions besides booking via an OTA? Would I be able to maybe get the booking done by directly calling the airline? (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)
",156470,"This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.

Airline search algorithms are often inferior

For single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.

If the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as ""undecidable""), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.

Alternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.

Solutions


Try the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.
Bookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)
Call the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)



  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)


BA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. 

Point-of-sale differences in inventory

Sometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that ""how many seats left for sale on a plane"" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.

This only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.

Ticket issuance restrictions in the fare

Sometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued ""on the stock"" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:

Category 15: Sales restrictions
  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.
         NOTE -
          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR
          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.


Even though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own ""paper"", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting ""125-"") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting ""421-""). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. 

This really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.

If you don't want your fellow pax seeing what you are taking, then either use a pill calendar as I did, or take it into the bathroom.  For a single dose or day's worth, you could substitute 1-2  small ziplocs for the pill calendar.

Another option is, after security, sit at a table in a restaurant or seating at a gate no one is at, and go through your pill bottles and put your next dose in a small ziploc you brought along.  You could do the same in the airplane lavatory, but that is very rude if there's a line.

As of March 30, 2020, all passengers flying in Canada will be subject to a health check prior to boarding. You will not be permitted to board if you: 


show any symptoms of COVID-19 or
have been refused boarding in the past 14 days due to a medical reason related to COVID-19 or
are subject to a provincial or local public health order


This also applies to travellers arriving from outside Canada.

If you are arriving from outside Canada and are deemed safe to fly, you may board a connecting flight to your destination. However, upon arrival at your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will isolate, and remain there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others.

You may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health measures at your final destination.

If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will not be allowed to board any flight until:


14 days have passed, or
you present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19


If you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to use public transportation to travel to the place where you will isolate.
",Accepted,"The I-571 Refugee Travel Document is perfectly sufficient for re-entering the US. You should have no trouble with it unless you do something that makes the US question your status as an asylee... such as using the passport of the country you claimed asylum from.

It is a very, very bad idea to continue to use that passport in a way that the US might find out about it. If the US learns you are still using it, your asylee status could be revoked. This also means it's a very bad idea to have the Mexican visa placed in it. The details of everyone's departure from the US by air is passed to the government by the airlines; this is how the US does not have exit immigration controls as most countries do. If your departure is recorded on the passport of the country you claimed asylum from, your status is at risk.

You should apply for the Mexican visa with your Refugee Travel Document instead. This is perfectly safe and you do not have to worry about entering Mexico or returning to the US.

3917,156501,Why do some airlines and air travel agencies send confirmation emails even if the flight has been cancelled?,"During these weeks many flights had been cancelled because of the COVID-19.

Why do some airlines and air travel agencies send confirmation emails even if the flight has been cancelled?



Examples:


LATAM: Flights from Peru were cancelled because of the state of emergency. However, one day before the flight, my flight was still appearing as SCHEDULED.

I called LATAM to ask if the flight is indeed scheduled and not cancelled. They told me that so far they do not have that specific flight marked as cancelled in their systems and they recommended to check the next day (the day of the flight). They mentioned a refund can't be done because the flight is not cancelled.

Obviously, during the night, SCHEDULED turned into CANCELLED.
Delta Airlines: Flight cancelled, but they send emails how to prepare for the flight and how to reach the airport and buy seats.
Kiwi.com and Opodo.com.uk: Flight cancelled, but they send notifications via email and push notifications to prepare for the flight and prepare my bags etc.




Apart from technical issues, is there any strategy in this scenario (e.g. marketing, whatever)?

I am a programmer and I can imagine that in the source code they can simply have an if condition checking if the flight was cancelled to not send any notifications anymore related to how to prepare for the flight.
",156502,"'I'm a programmer...'

International airline ticketing systems are huge, complex systems requiring interaction with the public, the staff, and other huge complex ticketing systems. Ensuring an accurate and timely flow of information through such a structure is no mean feat.

These systems were built for an environment where most flights departed on or fairly close to schedued time. In a matter of weeks the world has gone from that to an environment where most flights are now cancelled.

Your 'simple ""if""' may not be simple at all, but assuming the change was to be made, the process of approval, development, testing, staging and deployment could easily take weeks. There simply hasn't been time for such development to take place, even assuming that the developers consider that it's worthwhile.

I suggest that with the chaos currently reigning in the air travel industry, receiving an email with directions to the airport has been considered unimportant. 

Airlines have bigger fish to fry.
",Accepted,"In a free market like in the UK, prices are generally governed by demand and supply and customers Willingness To Pay (WTP). Pricing and Analytics is big business with advanced data crunching and thousands of variables.

It’s as simple as that. So far as consumers are willing to pay a certain price there is little motivation to reduce it.

If and when customers are unwilling to pay the price, the price will drop to the point where they are willing to pay for the goods or service. At that point if the price is such that the company’s costs are exceeding its income, the company either go bust or finds cost cutting measures and efficiencies or sometimes subsidized by government.

Bottom line the prices are high because customers still purchase. Although they both transport people, airlines and trains are not perfect competitors. Each has peculiarities that appeal to a segment of the consumer base at a particular price point.

The REAL ID law is the issue. I know PA is late to the game in their real ID licenses, so there was supposedly a law that until we get those, we would need a passport to fly domestically. But I’ve also heard that the law was postponed so I’m not sure what the current status is.

To reduce the need for people to go to DMV offices during the coronavirus pandemic, the deadline of October 1, 2020 has been postponed until October 1, 2021.  Thanks to choster for linking to an initial report by Bloomberg News.

Several news organizations have been reporting the new deadline at least since yesterday evening.  An official press release from the acting Secretary of Homeland Security is dated yesterday, March 26 2020.

The page quoted below has now been updated, as have the quotes themselves.  I've also adjusted the answer to account for the fact that Pennsylvania is now compliant with Real ID rather than being on an extension.



Have a look at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs:


  Q: When will I need to change how I travel domestically?
  
  Beginning October 1, 2021 every state and territory resident will need to present a REAL ID compliant license/ID, or another acceptable form of identification, for accessing Federal facilities, entering nuclear power plants, and boarding commercial aircraft. The card, itself, must be REAL ID compliant unless the resident is using an alternative acceptable document such as a passport or passport card, or state-issued Enhanced Driver’s License. The Act does not require individuals to present identification where it is not currently required to access a Federal facility (such as to enter the public areas of the Smithsonian) nor does it prohibit an agency from accepting other forms of identity documents (such as a U.S. passport or passport card).


You can use a Pennsylvania-issued document (license or ID card), even if the document is not compliant, through September 30, 2021.  After that, you'd need a compliant document or one issued by the federal government (for example, a passport or passport card).

Is Pennsylvania compliant?  Does it have an extension?  See the main Real ID page at https://www.dhs.gov/real-id, which shows a map indicating that Pennsylvania is compliant.  You can choose Pennsylvania in the ""select a state"" box below the map to see the details:


  Pennsylvania is compliant with the REAL ID Act. Federal agencies can accept driver's licenses and identification cards from Pennsylvania at Federal facilities and nuclear power plants.


On or after October 1, 2021, you'll need a Real-ID-compliant driver's license or your passport (or another document from the TSA list, if you have one).

I don't want to really just go to China, if I can claim my flights and hotels in China back I'd rather postpone the whole trip, plus I'd have to get extra hotels and activities planned for the time I would have been in North Korea.

I'm not really asking for legal advice, just wondered in general, if any country closes its border, is it valid for an insurance claim?

Not really an answer to my question, just if anyone else is travelling to China soon and you don't have insurance then try your luck contacting companies if you don't have insurance.

This is our travel plan:


06-03-2020: Munich -> London -> Tokyo
27-03-2020: Tokyo -> London -> Munich


We are mainly worried about two possibilities:


The airports shutting down, preventing us from getting back (my boss wouldn't be too happy).
Ending up in quarantine because we have an infected person on the plane.


While there, we planned on staying mainly in the countryside anyways, so the risk of getting infected ourselves is rather low in my opinion.
",154243,"This question is likely to get closed as opinion-based, but a few reference points:


Unless things get positively apocalyptic, it is exceedingly unlikely that Japan's airports would shut down completely.  Flights might be reduced, but as a comparison point, airports in China -- even in Wuhan -- have kept operating throughout the crisis there.
On the inbound flight, this would require an infected person coming from Munich or London, which is statistically improbable.  On the way back, this is a higher possibility, but still unlikely unless (again) there's a major outbreak.


FWIW, I was in Tokyo last week, and while it's not exactly panic in the air, people are definitely taking precautions: temperature scans at the airport, more masks than usual, hand washing &amp; sanitizers, large gatherings cancelled, etc .

It is difficult to guess what measures will be taken by the various authorities in Iran, Qatar and Austria regarding quarantine and isolation, or even outright travel bans, as this can change by the hour.

Qatar Airways have already cancelled 2 out of 3 of the flights from Tehran to Doha these last few days, and in the upcoming days.

Even if there are no bans or quarantines, and even taking into account switching to a larger plane and cancellations/rebookings, squeezing passengers booked on 3 different flights on a single probably means severe overbooking. Be prepared to be bumped off the flight if there are Qatari citizens or residents and/or premium passengers that need a seat on that plane.

The remaining flight on Saturday has been rescheduled to over an hour earlier. Add to that there will probably be lots of additional checks before boarding, and the fact that there will be overbooking, and you should be at the airport a LOT earlier that you would normally have, probably before midnight. You want to be the first in the queue. If online/mobile check-in is possible, do it as soon as it opens. You want your boarding pass to show ""SEQ 001"".

I suppose the rescheduling is to account for additional checks on arrival (as well as thorough disinfection of the aircraft after the flight) in order not to have issues with short connections.

Current Qatar Airways procedures for flights from Iran:


  In line with various global and local health warnings, all incoming passengers from Iran and South Korea whose final destination is Doha and are showing no symptoms of the Novel Coronavirus will be asked to stay in home isolation or a quarantine facility for 14 days.
  
  Passengers arriving from those countries who are showing symptoms will be transferred to the Communicable Disease Centre at the Hamad Medical Corporation.


So if you do not show any symptoms and are only in transit, you should have no issue boarding the flight to Vienna, unless Austria implements bans or quarantines by then.

When asking which changes were possible, they offered the same flight for the 11th of March. I asked if there could be some problem because of the novel coronavirus and they said they had no information. We changed our flight to March 11th, because they said that if the same happened again and it was cancelled again we could get the refund.

Get on a Turkish Airlines flight from Europe to Istanbul, and from there a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to the US.  Since Turkey is not on the travel ban of either country, the flights continue as planned.  Also, since I am not ""entering"" Turkey but merely transiting through it, this is also allowed by Turkey.

I haven't reached out to them yet, because usually, if canceling a trip to a a language school, they require you to pay the entire fee of 1,000 € (no spelling error), unless you prove you were ill (by going to a doctor). But maybe, they make an exception due to the circumstances - I think I should reach out to them soon. 
I currently live in Germany in a big city and my dad is a taxi driver who often has guests from the airport as well, so the question is: Aren't I equally exposed to the Corona-virus in Germany, i.e. at home? 
On the 6th April, my term officially starts, and from mid-April, I wanted to start my Bachelor Thesis, so it would be great if I weren't in quarantine in April. 
Also, I care about getting the virus to my home community - I mean, who doesn't? But then, the question is, shouldn't my dad stop taxi driving for a while? I told him my opinion, but he said we need money for a living. 
I have already booked the tickets for 360€ and after having informed myself, I probably would get back only 44€. However, I understandably don't care about the money right now. 


EDIT: Alright, I searched for an alternative and found one: I could take a ""Flixbus"" from Frankfurt (Main) Central Station to Barcelona directly and vice versa. The costs for the entire trip would be around 100€, and I can get easily from Hannover to Frankfurt/from Frankfurt to Hannover with an IC(E). However, the only question is whether I have to travel or not ... I mean, if the situation should escalate in Barcelona/Spain/Europe, then I could be in quarantine and that wouldn't be great. 

EDIT EDIT: If sb wants to now, I decided to cancel my trip. I will lose around 1,050 € at least, since my scholarship isn't ready to officially cancel the trip.

",154543,"Spain itself does not seem particularly risky, it's not the country most impacted in Europe, it has fewer cases than either France or Germany, most of them tourists or imported cases and is not considered a “risk area“.

Still, there are several things to be aware of:


Traveling in general does increase your exposure (to this and other viruses), you would be spending hours in enclosed spaces and at times crowded public transportation, which, everything else being equal, is riskier than staying at home in either of the countries you would be crossing.
The itinerary you describe would have you going through France, which is developing into one of the most severely affected countries in Europe. There are several clusters whose source hasn't been fully elucidated, including one very close to Paris. At this moment, the French government does not advise against travel in general (only in the Oise and Haute-Savoie département) but the situation could evolve quickly. It did activate “stage 2” of its emergency plan meaning the virus is circulating through the population and the focus is on slowing it down rather than isolating clusters and risk areas.
If the situation worsens, you could conceivably be putting others at risk. There are few restrictions on travel in Europe and blanket bans or border closures seem unlikely but if anything, Spanish authorities should be more concerned about people like you coming from France than you should be about being in Spain.
It's possible the outbreak would develop further while you are in Spain to the point of making your return more difficult or, indeed, mean isolation would be recommended when coming back to Germany. You cannot know this before leaving (and I speak from experience as this just happened to me coming back from Italy).

  If your name has legally changed through marriage, divorce, or a court

8924,154619,Is it safer to travel by bus than by train in times of COVID-19?,"I have a language course booked in two weeks in Barcelona and would like to get there either by train or bus (due to 'flight shame') from Germany in times of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

Going by train would mean traveling via Cologne (Germany), Brussels, Paris (that makes me really afraid), on the return journey via Paris and Frankfurt Main (Germany). However, there is also a Flixbus directly going to Barcelona from Frankfurt. 

Though I already booked the train tickets via Paris, I could stil get a refund and thereby get most of the money back. :-) So what would you say, is it safer to travel by bus rather than by train? 

However, I was also wondering whether trains aren't equally safe as buses, since I could just stand all the time in a TGV in the floor or just sit on my luggage where there aren't so many people?
",154621,"It is somewhat hard to answer this one. You obviously concerned, but not enough to forfeit the course and cancel the trip. You are a bit afraid, but not enough so to overcome you 'flight shame' and hop on a direct plane. 

However, you are afraid enough to consider either spending a 25-hour trip on a Flixbus or a 13-hour train trip standing on the corridor. For some reason you are more afraid of Paris than Cologne or Barcelona, and more afraid of trains than buses.

At this point, my honest suggestion is that you do whatever makes you feel most comfortable. 

Given that you have already decided to travel, and to travel by either train or bus, the choice between those two matters little.

On a train, you'll be in a carriage with 120 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. In a bus you'll be with 60 people. A dozen or so in close proximity to you. There is no evidence that one is significantly riskier than the other.

If you want to minimise your time with people, take a plane or rent a car.
",Reasonable,"Yes, this is possible; I have done it, though it was about a decade ago.  I can't remember which form I completed to surrender my lawful permanent resident status, but it currently seems to be an I-407.  It was surrendered when I was applying to enter the US.  Once it was done I was admitted for that trip, but strongly advised to apply for a US B1/B2 visa even though I'm a citizen of a visa-waiver country.

When I did apply, after my return home, the application process was thorough, but it seemed fair, and the visa was approved.  However, I don't think the US government plays games like ""I'd like to surrender this green card, but only on condition that I get a visa"", so you are taking the risk that your visa(s) won't be approved, and you'll find yourselves unable to visit your daughter.  Note also that visas can be pretty easily revoked, which is not true for LPR status, and that possession of a visa is no guarantee of admission.  You'd be putting yourself at the whims of the current US president and his tendency to make decrees affecting the travel of citizens of arbitrary nations, and you may not wish to do that.

But yes, it is perfectly possible.

All three legs of the travel are booked through bahn.de, and the Germany into Switzerland leg I can find back on the system of that site. I have asked a question and they will (or at least should) get back to me on that.

The other two legs, (one from Basel to Milan, the other from Milan to Naples,) are booked by bahn.de on Trenitalia, and the German site does not recognize the PNR number for the booking.

In most cases I would not bother to try to cancel/get a refund as they are super economy tickets which do not allow refunds, but with the health situation in Northern Italy, I want to try to get a partial or full refund, (just like I would get from the airlines if they have to cancel flight.)

I hope someone is able to tell me how to ask for the (partial) refund or whether it is better to wait till almost the day of travel. The date on the ticket is 18th of March, 2020.
",154737,"Italian long distance train tickets work along a completely different system then German train tickets. Italian trains have passenger manifests. German trains don't.  That is why you cannot find any Italian PRNs in the German system. Deutsche Bahn does not use PNRs at all (as they do not care the slightest bit about who is on their trains...)
You could try if you can find your PNRs on the Trenitalia website. But I do not know if you could cancel your tickets there. Cancelling tickets you should do via the agent you booked them with. 

If you created a login with bahn.de you should be able to see your orders there, and maybe cancel them, and you can otherwise just email them. 

But you also may just be out of luck. I had to cancel a trip to Germany because of the COVID-19 situation, and I am not getting any refunds either. See if your travel insurance will refund them. 
",Reasonable,"For flights, it could be problematic and would depend on where you are flying to and from, your citizenship, and the experience and mood of the staff checking you in.  

In such cases, the airline staff that check you in have a certain amount of discretion and for some journeys, they may well allow it, just as they would allow a case of first name, initial, last name.

In other cases, some airlines may seize on the opportunity to levy an additional charge at checkin to change the name to match.  I have had this before when 2 letters in my name were transposed.  A US$250 typo!

Many airports now require self check-in.  A machine is almost certainly not going to allow you to pass without intervention from an airline representative. 

One specific problem situation may arise if you are not a U.S. citizen and are attempting to board a flight to the U.S.  In this case, it is unlikely that any airline would take the risk of allowing you to board.  The reason being the huge amount of passenger data that the U.S. government requires, and the amount of checks and pre-processing that is done.  If the airline perceives any risk that a discrepancy could cause you to be denied entry to the U.S. (or any other country for that matter), then they will not allow you to board.

Almost every advice you are likely to receive is to ensure that the name printed on your ticket matches the name of our passport.

8983,154755,Should I bother cancelling if the traveller is planning not to show up for a flight?,"As part of my job, I helped my university to buy
an airline ticket for a student from city A to city B.
Due to the COVID-19 disease outbreak,
the student decided that it was too risky to travel,
and so he/she will remain in city A.

I noticed the following text in the electronic ticket:


  TICKET IS NON-REFUNDABLE
  
  NO SHOW PENALTY AT USD 250 PER TICKET


Questions:


Will my university or the student have to pay a no-show penalty
if he/she does not show up for the flight?
Should I take the effort to cancel the tickets with the airline?

Since the tickets are non-refundable,
I am assuming that my university will not get any money back for cancelling the tickets,
so there does not seem to be any benefit to us for cancelling the tickets.


(Note: city B is not yet a super high risk destination for COVID-19,
so I don't foresee the airline allowing a full refund for the airline tickets.)



I explain what I decided to do in the answer below.
",154764,"Non-refundable doesn't mean what you seem to assume - it does not mean that the money is lost. It means that you don't get it back.

That might seem an irrelevant difference, but often it is not - you can use the value of the ticket for further bookings with the airline (for the same flier, not just anybody).
If you cancel the ticket, you typically have 365 days (from day of payment, not day of flight) to use the value for another booking.

The no-show fee is a fee that gets taken out of your remaining value - if the flier simply doesn't show up (instead of cancelling), he will not get the full ticket value parked, but it will be reduced by the no-show fee.
So you should definitely cancel, as it will save the no-show fee. Only if the person is not going to fly within a full year is the ticket value completely lost.
",Reasonable,"I think the key word in your initial statement is that you heard about it.  The fact that this occurred was deemed serious enough that it made it to the international news outlets.  Now, of course, that's not to say that every such incident makes the news, but it does mean that such incidents are obviously rare or there would be more than very occasional such incidents being reported.

Unfortunately discrimination can and does occur on airlines, just like it occurs in most parts of the world - but the odds of it escalating to the point of you being kicked off the plane or your wife being forced to remove her headscarf would be so low as to be considered zero on most airlines and in most countries around the world.

Specific to your wife's head covering, there are situations where she could be asked to remove it, but this should be done in a private area.  For example, here are the USA's TSA comments on head coverings.

As far as what you can do to minimize the chances of an incident, the only advice I could give would be the same that I'd give to any passenger, regardless of race or religion - consider the feelings of everyone else on the plane, and try not to do anything that would cause any undue impact or concerns to others on the plane.  For example, there was a recent report of a passenger praying whilst on a plane, which people took offence at - not for religious reasons, but because in doing so he was blocking access to the aisles and toilets.

Similarly I would probably not recommend you decide to start speaking Arabic to another passenger located on the other side of the plane (ie, at a high volume) - just as I would not recommend a passenger shout out a welcome to his friend Jack on the other side of the plane (""Hi Jack!"").

In a perfect world, such discrimination would not exist, but the simple fact is it does. As much as I hate to give advice to try and minimize your profile in places such as (Western) airports and aircraft, the simple fact is that doing so will likely result in an easier trip for you.

Now if I changed my planned destination and to visit Greece (by flight via Paris) instead, can I enter France with my already issued Italian Schengen Visa?

I can provide my new air ticket and hotel reservations, but I won't go to Italy at all. What other options I can choose if I need to make the trip on the same dates?
",154850,"EDIT: This is a fast evolving situation. Under the current circumstances I suggest anyone planning to come to Europe just cancel or postpone. 

A Schengen visa normally allows one to enter any Schengen country. 
There is no obligation to enter the Schengen area through the country that issued your visa. 
So entering via France (or any other country) is not an issue. 
It is pretty common even.

The rule that you must apply to the consulate of the country that is your main destination exists to spread the workload, and to counter visa shopping. 
To enforce that rule the immigration officer stamping you in may want to see hotel and flight reservations proving that indeed you plan to follow the itinerary on your Schengen Visa application. 
Arriving at the border with evidence suggesting that your plans are very different from those stated in your application will raise red flags, and may lead to a refusal.

This under normal circumstances. 
However we are no longer under normal circumstances. 
Deciding to no longer visit Italy is completely reasonable in light of the current situation. 
So I would guess that cutting Italy out of your plans is not going to raise a red flag. 
You should however inquire with the French consulate and the  French border police (dcpaf-em-cnic@interieur.gouv.fr).

One last thing: 
The way things are currently progressing all of Europe will be where Italy is now in about 10 days (and so might your home country). 
You might want to completely postpone your trip. 
",Reasonable,"Ethiopia was formerly a fully state-controlled, Marxist economy and despite slow liberalization, many sectors remain government controlled.  This includes aviation, where Ethiopian Airlines has a de facto monopoly on domestic flights.  Hence fares are both high and fixed: it's a legacy of state control and there's no competition.

That said, it may apparently be possible to score cheaper flights via travel agencies in Ethiopia, so it may be worth exploring other options.  Bear in mind that Internet penetration in Ethiopia also remains low, so if your schedule is flexible, it might make sense to do this after arrival.

Incidentally, Ethiopia is not alone in this pricing scheme, I recall running into the same system in eg. Laos and a number of Central Asian countries as well.  Often there's a dual pricing system that charges top dollar for foreigners and has subsidized pricing for locals, but I'm not sure if this is the case for Ethiopia as well.  (Update: It appears this is indeed the case, with a 66% discount for residents &amp; people traveling to/from Ethiopia on Ethiopian Airlines.)

Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.

Protection measures for everyone
Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:


Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

Since the e-Gates are using the image (stored in the chip) in your passport, two people having faces looking almost the same and going through the gates so soon after each other should trigger a warning.

To solve this you could do plastic surgery or maybe use different flights so that the time between using the e-Gates is larger. I guess the timeout could be just 5 minutes.

You could also try wearing a hat, glasses or makeup.

9008,154910,How does the US COVID-19 travel ban apply to the EU spouse of a US citizen?,"I am a French citizen, legally married to a US citizen. I currently live in Germany while my husband lives in the US.

I was supposed to fly to the US on Sunday (March 15) on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to visit my husband in the US for two weeks (until March 30). I am wondering if I can still get on the flight, and whether I should.

It is clear in the presidential proclamation that the travel restriction does not apply to spouses of US citizens. However I wonder how this is enforced. I travel with my French passport and an ESTA (visa waiver), I do not have any spouse visa or anything. Is it the airline who decides to let me on the flight? Or is it up to the immigration officer once I arrive in the US?

I also don't know if the flight is going to be cancelled. As far as the flight status shows, it is not cancelled, but I wouldn't trust that.

To make matters more difficult for myself, I got a United reservation through Chase's travel rewards program for a flight operated by Lufthansa. If the flight is cancelled or I cannot get on it, any idea who I should turn to for reimbursement? So far I have not been able to get a hold of Lufthansa customer service, they must be overloaded. I have not yet tried United or Chase.

Sorry this is such a specific and self-interested question, I just thought some of you might have similar situations or more information to share.
",154911,"There are still a lot of unknowns at this stage, so it is quite difficult to answer with any degree of certainty.


I expect you would need to be able to prove to someone (probably the airline, and then again CBP upon arrival in the US) that you are the spouse of a US citizen. Make sure you have a copy of your marriage certificate or other similar document, as well as a copy of your husband's passport.
There is a strong probability that many flights will be cancelled, though as US citizens and their immediate family are still allowed to travel to the US, there should still be a few flights. Which ones will be operating and which ones will be cancelled is the one million dollar question. You'll have to wait for Lufthansa to make a decision, taking into account that this could change quite late.


I expect airlines to get in touch with passengers to:


Inform them of these new measures, and the exact details of what documents are required/allowed.
Probably ask information so they know which passengers are still able to travel or not, which in turn will let them decide how many flights to keep, and which ones.


Given the surprise announcement, they're probably scrambling to make all of that happen.

If the flight is cancelled, you should be eligible for a refund. You should probably contact Chase at that point.

If the flight is NOT cancelled but you decide not to travel, we enter in the very gray area that the airline is probably not legally required to refund your ticket. They will most probably instead propose rebooking at a later date or the like. The fact that it's an award ticket may change things (is the ticket refundable?). Again, Chase is probably the right point of contact for this.

EDIT

The Lufthansa Group have announced the cancellation of all but 6 flights to/from the US from March 14th:


  The Lufthansa Group will continue operating flights from:
  
  
  Frankfurt to Chicago and Newark (New York)
  Zurich to Chicago and Newark (New York)
  Vienna to Chicago and from
  Brussels to Washington
  
  
  beyond 14 March, thus maintaining at least some air traffic connections to the USA from Europe. The airlines are currently working on an alternative flight schedule for the USA. Passengers will still be able to reach all destinations within the USA via the U.S. hubs and connecting flights served by our partner airline, United Airlines.
  
  All other U.S. flights will be suspended until further notice due to U.S. administration restrictions, including all departures from Munich, Düsseldorf and Geneva. The Lufthansa Group will continue to serve all destinations in Canada until further notice.

For existing bookings, the new waiver policy will apply worldwide to all flights booked by March 5 with a departure date up to April 30, 2020.

  If you booked through an (online) travel agency, please contact the travel agency.


I say ""might"" because I don't know whether you'd be able to get a refund if the flight is cancelled after you rebook it.

Taxes and fees

Even if you cannot recover your airfare, you should be entitled to a refund of certain taxes and fees for flights that you didn't actually take.

If you have any travel insurance or other general insurance, you may want to look at whether it would cover any losses you incur.

My concern is if the current coronavirus pandemic can be cited as a reason for visa refusal by the Netherlands embassy. I.e., does the current pandemic increase the likelihood of visa refusal when compared to normal circumstances? Are there any rules in visa policy of Schengen Area that concern with situations like this?

UPDATE: To clarify, my concern here is if the current pandemic will increase the likelihood of visa refusal. (Whether or not I'll be able to travel to the Netherlands in April is a different issue). The reason I'm separating these two concerns is because with new EU visa rules, I may qualify for a long validity visa (as I've been issued multiple Schengen visas in past), so if in the unfortunate case I've to postpone my April trip, I can do so &amp; re-plan on a much shorter notice. Whereas if I don't apply for a visa now and do so later, I'll have to plan for weeks in advance again (as I must apply for a visa 15 working days / 3 weeks in advance).

UPDATE: If the Netherlands issues a travel restriction in near future, will that result in a visa refusal or application rejection?
",154932,"There are restrictions in place, but AFAIK no current restrictions for Indian citizens/residents applying for Dutch visa. On the other hand, the Czech Republic closed their visa processing centers in China and Hong Kong several weeks ago, effectively preventing residents of China from applying for a Czech visa. It is at the moment difficult to predict what happens tomorrow or in the next days, but it is of course not impossible, that more Schengen countries will follow and impose restrictions on visa issuance.

Independent of the visa, it may also by mid-April be impossible to travel to the Netherlands. Several Schengen countries have today or in the past few days established very strict travel regulations or bans, effectively preventing many or most tourists and visitors from entering.
",Reasonable,"Whatever happens, if you apply right now, your chances of getting a visa will be best. If your application is rejected because of Coronavirus fears, that wouldn't be held against you in the future. 

Obviously having a visa will not guarantee that you can enter the Netherlands. There might be no flights.

9057,154938,Visit Finland with visa issued from Norway during the COVID-19 outbreak,"we were intending to travel to Norway ( more days) and Finland (2days) from 18.03.2020 till 1.04.2020. Now due to  the quarantine mandate issued by the Norway government to all foreign nationals entering Norway it's difficult to complete the norway part of our tour. we had a Finnair Flight via Helsinki to Norway and we were leaving from Helsinki after 2 days stay there. 
Under this unusual situation is it possible that we do the entire tour in Finland without visiting Norway at all. Schengen visa has been issued by Norway.
this is an unusual situation as we will be compelled to be in quarantine irrespective of the health status in Norway. so there is no use in visiting the country. But we also do not want to cancel our plan. so checking out and need advice whether we can do the entire tour in Finland though originally Finland constituted a lesser part of our tour.
",154941,"I must say that nobody knows what's going to happen and that the situation is developing quickly in Europe.

First I would suggest that you talk to your airline.  Normally if you miss a single segment then the whole rest of your trip (including your return) would be cancelled automatically.

Given the circumstances then the airlines are generally being very flexible, but you must first check what they will and will not allow and then change your itinery accordingly and not just not take a flight.  

Next (or in parrallel) I would suggest contacting your local Finnish embassy and explaining the situation.  Tell them that your Schengen visa was issued by Norway, that you are flying via Helsinki anyway and would now like to spend the enture trip there rather than the couple of days you previously planned.  And then ask if they would, given the circumstances, allow you to enter and remain therer for xx days.

It really depends on how flexible they are.
They might allow this.  They might say that you should get a new visa issued.  They might reduce or waive the cost.  But you should check first.

If I was you, I would also consider making alternative plans.  Talk to the airline about rescheduling the trip, as it is likely that they will allow you to do this free of charge at the moment.

Only you can judge if this is a worthwhile trip for you given the cirumstances.
My personal opinion is that the next two weeks are going to get worse, and it will be awhile before the situation improves.  
",Reasonable,"Up to now, the European Commission has given no advice about how to deal with any irregularities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak for the area of issued visas and their usage within the Schengen Area. 

In the European Commission Coronavirus response site, this topic is not meantioned at all. This is a sign that it is considered a low priority matter. 

So should Norway or the Czech Republic not let anybody in


it is a case of force majeure


that could not be forseen when the visa was issued.

9058,154945,"People exempt from Trump's COVID-19 proclamation, what is the quarantine/screening requirement?","You can read President Trump's full proclamation regarding conditions of travel between the US and Schengen zone here. Nowhere in this proclamation is a mention of a quarantine.

However, several major news outlets seem to be reporting different (and contradictory) things.

BBC reports: 


  Under President Donald Trump, the federal government has banned
  non-citizens from coronavirus-hit regions entry, but US citizens are
  allowed back into the country after a two-week quarantine.


Yet, CNN says 


  Returning travelers will be screened prior to entering the US and asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.


My question is, which is it? Will people exempt by the restriction face a mandated quarantine at the airport, or be told to self-quarantine? Nowhere in the official proclamation do I see mention of screening (which I am all for). If one of these people who is exempt from the restriction passes the screening (negative for the virus), are they free to go?
",154964,"According to the DHS announcement and fact sheet, the procedures for people who have been to Schengen Area countries within the last 14 days who are exempt from the ban (US citizens, permanent residents, and their immediate family members) are the same as the procedure for people who have been to Mainland China (but haven't been to Hubei province) or Iran within the last 14 days.

Basically, they will have to arrive in the US at one of 13 designated airports, where they will undergo medical examination. If they have no symptoms, they will be asked to self-monitor their health and limit interactions (the government also calls this ""self-quarantine"") until 14 days after they have left the Schengen Area, but there are no formal restrictions on where they can go.

Only people who have been to Hubei province within the last 14 days are subject to a formal, mandatory quarantine so far.
",Reasonable,"You do not need an emergency travel document.

Until you announce to the USA government that you have completed transition and provide documentation, they will not unilaterally change your sex in the records.

Thus your travel documents with previous sex still holds valid until you officially effect those changes when you return to the USA.

Your sex is not officially determined by your appearance. We are long past that period of stereotyping based purely on looks. There are many people who look like the opposite sex. Also there are many people who look radically different from their passport pictures including people who have transitioned but have not yet reassigned their official gender.

In conclusion, regardless of how your friend looks now and how different his/her appearance is from what is on her official documents, he/she will be let in if he/she can prove with documentation that she/he is who she/he claims he/she is. Yes you will spend a little longer at immigration on arrival and when checking in at the departure airport however this is nothing new.

  Under the new policy, a transgender person can obtain a passport

On the day you're planning your departure you have a valid visa, so the first criteria is fulfilled. You haven't said anything that allows us to say whether you will have obeyed the 90/180 rule.

But consider that your plane is cancelled or delayed for another reason, then you will suddenly not have a valid visa anymore, and thus have broken the rules.

They are all different, so you need to read the exclusions of the one that you have or plan on getting. They also get updated frequently. I checked a few today and about half of them to claim during the booking process that they cover Coronavirus related medical expenses. Interesting enough, it was quite cheap, so it doesn't seem like the insurance companies think this is a big risk. 
",Reasonable,"This question is similar in nature to the one linked below and should also be read.

In general, it is not advised to finalize travel arrangements before a visa is issued. 

Some application forms explicitly state 'if known' when asking for an accommodation address, others don't.  

The Schengen Border Code does not state that suppling an address, upon application for a visa, is mandatory. 

You will, no doubt, be suppling a letter from your home institution in Russia.   

This letter, or in a second letter, should state that they will be organizing the travel and accommodation arrangements.   

If this letter also states that they prefer to do this after the application is granted, then it should be clear to the Embassy or Consulate why the field has not been filled. 

What is important is that the accommodation address must be known when entering the Schengen Area.

If you are travelling in your country of residence, go home and self-isolate there.  If travel restrictions make this impossible, contact the relevant authorities for advise.  Usually there are some exemptions for essential travel, and travelling from a potentially crowded hostel to your home may well count as valid travel.

If you are travelling in another country than your country of residence, contact your embassy.  Many embassies are attempting to repatriate their citizens.  Chances are your embassy is already working on trying to reach you if they know how to contact you (I received an email from my government already, but I have my home and job here and the situation in my mother country is no better than here, so it makes no sense for me to repatriate).

Now is not the time to travel for non-essential purposes.

I'm looking for an answer that applies to all such EU countries that have shut their borders for ""foreigners"", however, to use some example for my question, Poland states:


  Entry into Poland is still allowed for:
  
  a)               Nationals of Poland, their spouses and children.
  
  c)                Passengers with a temporary or permanent residence permit.


Now, as a not-Polish citizen but a citizen of another EU country, my understanding has always been that by default we have a temporary residence permit for any EU country we would like to travel to? (And obviously after 5 years we automatically get a permanent residence permit if stayed in the country)

Does this count as having a temporary residence permit (if I don't normally live in such country but would like to travel or transit there as a EU citizen)? 



P.S. There's a similar text for Czechia, Lithuania, Slovakia which is not as vague as Poland's:


  Passengers are not allowed to enter Czechia.
  
  - This does not apply to nationals of Czechia.
  
  - This does not apply to passengers with a Czech residence permit for stay over 90 days or for permanent stay.

  -This does not apply to residents of Lithuania
  
  Passengers are not allowed to enter Slovakia.

Given that there are exceptional circumstances, no compensation is due. However, you must still be given the option of a refund, though one can accept rerouting or rebooking.

As airlines are cash-strapped, they will try to convince you to take a voucher instead of a refund. You can agree to it if you want, but they cannot force you to do so. Remember that many airlines will fail due to this situation. A failed airline cannot honour a voucher or a rebooking (though it's quite probable quite a few will fail before owed refunds are paid).

Airlines are required to refund you within 7 days. Given the very large number of queries they are receiving at this time, and the precarious financial situation they are in, it will probably take much longer, though, and in many cases any appeal will take enough time for the airline to have failed before you get paid.
For other cancelled flights not covered by EC261, the rule should be the same (they couldn't provide the service, so they should provide a refund), but this will be governed by local laws and/or the airlines terms &amp; conditions (conditions of carriage).
Note that several other countries implement rules very similar (or even identical) to EC261, including Turkey, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine.
Note that you should only ask for the refund if you are at home. If you are stranded in a foreign country, getting a refund may complicate things a lot to secure alternate travel. Though EC261 requires the airline to provide both the refund and a return flight ""at the earliest opportunity"", in many cases the return flight you want may not be operated by the airline but via some other scheme.

If however your flight has not (yet) been cancelled, and you decide to change your plans, then you do not have the right to a full refund (unless the fare was fully refundable, of course). In theory, the original terms of your fare should apply (including fares being non-refundable, penalties, etc.). Most airlines will however offer to either rebook for free or provide a voucher valid for future travel (usually valid for a year). Note that in many cases, the rebooking options or voucher validity will be limited to one year from the original purchase date. I doubt any will offer a refund in this case.

This applies also if you change your plans because the situation at the destination is no longer suitable, or you will not be able to get to your hotel, or the conference or event you were planning to attend has been cancelled, or you are stuck in yet another country due to the current travel restrictions, etc. As long as it's not the airline cancelling the flight, no refunds are due.
The case of countries suddenly closing their borders to some categories of people (e.g. the US refusing entry to anyone having gone through the Schengen Area, UK, or Ireland in the past 14 days) probably falls in the last category: as long as the flight still operates, the airline usually is not required to provide a refund.
Airlines will often proactively suggest you rebook your travel or get a voucher. Once you have accepted that option, you are no longer eligible for a refund even if the flight you originally booked ends up being cancelled.
For hotels, the rules are basically the same, though I'm not aware of any blanket legislation like EC261:


If the hotel cancels the booking (because they will be closed or completely inaccessible), you should in general be eligible for a refund, even if the fare was non-refundable.
If the hotel is still able to honour your booking, but you just can't get there (because there are no flights, borders are closed, you're stuck in another country, region or city) or no longer want to get there (you no longer want to travel, the event you wanted to attend has been cancelled...), then you are in general not eligible for a refund.

Here again, the hotel may apply the original rules of the booking (no refunds or changes at all), or they can (and many will) allow for a rebooking at a later date or a voucher. But ultimately, that is their choice.

Travel booked as a ""package"" (flight + hotel, sometimes other components as well) sold by a travel agent or tour operator usually have additional protections, especially those sold by EU companies. Most importantly, if the flight is cancelled or the hotel at the destination is unreachable/closed, one is eligible for a refund of the whole package, whereas when both are booked separately, one may be able to get a refund for one but not the other.
Added 18/3/2020 In some places, the government has changed the rules, and explicitly authorises some actors to not refund, and instead only provide a voucher valid for one year. See this answer for Belgium for such an exemple.


Let's add that this is were travel insurance should come into play, but double-check any exclusions and conditions that may apply. Also, don't forget that you may have multiple travel insurances: many credit cards have a travel insurance automatically included for all travel bought using the card. Check the conditions and exclusions of any that may apply (you can of course only get refunded by a single one).
",Reasonable,"As usual, it depends. I haven't been to all Philippines (only to 14 or so cities), so take this with a grain of salt.

Every public toilet I used there was reasonably clean. Most weren't exactly as shown on your link, and some (for example on a local market in Cebu) didn't have running water (there's a bucket of water nearby and you flush with a ladle), but it didn't look or felt filthy. From my experience it's similar to Thailand, and way above a typical toilet in India.

What was common, however, was the lack of toilet paper. Even paid toilets sometime (not always) had only tissues, and usually for extra fee - although minor.

And as you guess, pay toilets and those closer to touristy areas are generally cleaner and more stocked.

I am just wondering whether they can reject my application because of coronavirus, or would they still issue me a visa but advise me not to travel?

I had applied for the Netherlands. 
",155096,"This is a very dynamic and unprecedented situation, so nobody knows for sure what will happen.  So below is more of an opinion rather than known fact.

As it currently stands, travel into the 26 EU states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, is prohibited for 30 days and as such travel is banned for all non-EU citizens or residents (except UK citizens).

Assuming your travel request falls within this period then the following is likely.


They could reject you current application and tell you to reapply in
the future.  That this rejection will not be looked upon negatively
when you apply, and you should get a full refund of any fees paid.
Or they could put your application on hold and ask you in the future
if you wish to proceed or not with new dates.  If not, then you would
get a full refund.
They could approve your visa, but issue it with different dates and/or
an extended travel period.  e.g.  instead of 90 in 180 days, then 90
in 270 days.


If your travel request is for later than this period then the following could occur:


Issue the visa but advise you that you will only be able to travel if
the borders reopen.  If the borders don't reopen in time, you have to
apply again.  You may or may not have to pay the fees again in such a case.
Stop processing and ask you if you wish to postpone or withdraw your
application, and refund the fees
Stop processing temporarily.  Continue processing when the situation
improves, if your application is far enough in the future
Reject the application, and tell you to reapply again when the situation is clearer.  Refund the fees.


If the visa is rejected due to the Corona shutdown, then it will not be looked upon negatively when you apply again in the future and you should get a full refund.
",Reasonable,"This happens quite regularly for multi-carrier trips. Less so for single carrier trips.

Airline search algorithms are often inferior

For single carrier trips, it's almost always because the airline's search algorithm doesn't find the trip you want, not because the airline doesn't sell it.

If the search tool is an in-house product, it may be inferior in an absolute sense compared to something like ITA's QPX search, which many OTAs now use. Writing a search algorithm for airline flights is a terrifically hard problem (formally it is classed as ""undecidable""), and airlines don't hire the kind of computer scientists who can solve it efficiently. Specialists like ITA have hundreds of computer scientists.

Alternatively, an airline's search may be tuned with different preferences to an OTA. A lot of airlines try to avoid overnight stops, even if that would be preferable to three flights at a higher price. I would guess that's the cause of your SAS problem here.

Solutions


Try the multicity search, and put some of the connecting cities in as if they were stopovers. When you choose the dates, choose the dates that you'll actually fly that leg. This is often a good bet, but it sometimes causes the airline to price your trip with a fare break point at the stopover (i.e., as a sum of one way fares instead of a single through fare): Iberia.com is particularly terrible for this shortcut. However, I notice SAS has helpfully removed its multicity feature as part of the dumbing down exercise that makes the rest of its webpage unusable on a real computer.
Bookwithmatrix or Google Flights can sometimes link you directly to the desired itinerary on the airline's site. (If you do this on aa.com, you'll find that you get kicked out at the payment stage if your credit card's address isn't in the United States. But it turns out AA doesn't actually validate the country field, so you can just leave it set to United States.)
Call the airline, tell them what flight numbers you want to fly, and give them the price you expect. There is usually a telephone booking fee for doing this, although if you have some status with the airline it might be waived, particularly if you explain their website was not good enough to do it online. I used to have a friend at the Amsterdam ticketing desk for British Airways. In what I consider a crowning achievement some years ago, I constructed a price for a trip from information on expertflyer.com that was 50% lower than his system or any OTA admitted, and after some back and forth with revenue management, he agreed it was a bug in their pricing system and sold me the itinerary at the lower price. :-)



  (and if so, would this be standard practice, or should I expect it to be hit and miss depending on the airline?)


BA, AA, KLM, 90% success rate, sometimes have to hang up and call again. Qantas, JAL, Cathay Pacific, their telephone staff and ticket desks are always reliable. Air France, maybe 50%. Iberia, Alitalia, LATAM: total waste of time. 

Point-of-sale differences in inventory

Sometimes, additional inventory is available in the city where the travel agent is based, compared to where the airline is calculating the price. To understand why that can be the case, you should know that ""how many seats left for sale on a plane"" is a function of the sales city as well as other factors. Airline websites, in my experience, usually price from the city of origin, whereas agents usually price from a fixed point. One way to see this is from the payment currency, which will invariably be the currency of the sales city. For instance expedia.fr prices out of Paris, regardless of whether the itinerary passes through that city.

This only seems to matter when the flight is filling up.

Ticket issuance restrictions in the fare

Sometimes, the airline really cannot sell you the trip. This may be because the trip comprises multiple fares and one of the fares has a restriction that it must be issued ""on the stock"" of a ticket airline. Stock here refers to the old fashioned 4-part carbon paper tickets, but the concept is directly implemented in electronic ticketing. For instance, looking at a cheap S7 fare from London to Yekaterinburg:

Category 15: Sales restrictions
  TICKETS MUST BE ISSUED ON S7.
         NOTE -
          SALES PERMITTED ON TICKET STOCK VALIDATED OR
          PLATED S7/421 ONLY.


Even though a BA plane will fly you the first leg from London to Moscow, BA could not sell you a journey involving this particular fare. Airlines always sell tickets on their own ""paper"", not as agents for another airline; in this case, BA sells tickets on BA plate (ticket number starting ""125-"") and S7 sells tickets on S7 plate (ticket number starting ""421-""). But a travel agent could pick any validating carrier with whom it has a ticketing agreement, subject to the fare rules and the agreement. So the travel agent has some additional flexibility. 

This really only matters when you have a particularly complicated trip with multiple airlines who don't partner together very closely.

  Normally she would enter on a 90 days tourist visa, as we don't yet have a long term family reunification visa.


Your wife will never get a long-term family reunification visa because such visas are not issued to beneficiaries of the free movement directive.

As a beneficiary from a so-called ""Annex II"" country (that is, a country whose citizens do not need a visa for short visits), your wife is supposed to enter without a visa and then apply for a residence card after entering Germany.

The trick, of course, is to find specific information about how the travel ban is being applied to non-EU citizens who enjoy freedom of movement through a family relationship but who do not yet reside in Germany.  This may be difficult as the number of such cases is probably small and the possibility may not have been considered by the people writing the policies.

the best I have been able to find so far is at https://www.germany.info/us-en/coronavirus/2317268 (emphasis added):


  EU-citzens and citizens of Great Brtain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland and their family members will be allowed to transit through Germany to reach their home countries.


This suggests that beneficiaries of the free movement directive are included among those who may enter Germany.  Your wife might want to say that Germany is her place of residence (which is arguably true) but that she hasn't yet lived there long enough to get a residence card (which is certainly true).  Alternatively, she should call the German authorities and ask them what to tell the airline.  To that end, see How to contact border authorities in EU/Schengen countries? on this site.

Regarding the documents, you might try asking the airline if they will pass them to her when she gets off the plane.  My wife was in a similar situation recently, and that was the solution.

Part of this process was that the airline employee in the destination airport made a note in the airline's system that the documents were sufficient.  This was necessary for her to be able to board the plane without having the documents with her.  This may also prove necessary in your wife's case.

A visa cancellation while the bearer is en route to the US would normally be a cancellation with prejudice, because the bearer has been found inadmissible for some reason.

On the other hand, if you were prevented from flying to the US because of the travel ban related to COVID-19, I would think that your visa should not have been cancelled at all.

So I wonder whether there is some additional fact that you haven't mentioned that might explain exactly what happened.  If so, that might also have a bearing on the likelihood that a future visa application would succeed.
",Reasonable,"After seeing my comment on this question, @GayotFow shared his view of the issue via his blog, about the refusal of your fiancés Marriage Visitor Visa (MVV).  


  The OP is a British national whose fiance is in India and they want to use an MVV for the fiance to come the UK and get married.  This throws up a flag right off the bat…
  
  Background.  The MVV was invented in 2005 because Parliament found a no other way to accommodate a specific scenario:  A couple where both parties were non-EU nationals want to come to the UK and get married at a destination venue (such as a romantic castle in Scotland) and then leave the UK. The hospitality lobby had successfully argued that without a visa like this the hotel and catering industry would suffer a loss of revenue. So this visa was created and enacted.
  
  British nationals who want to marry a non-EU spouse are meant to use the existing fiance visa rules given in Appendix FM.  But these rules have a hefty fee attached to them and therein lies the confusion.  People look at the various options and see that a UK fiance visa fee is about GBP 1,500, whereas the fee for an MVV is only about GBP 90.  So the MVV is obviously the way to go, right?
  
  Well, no.  The fiance visa gives the holder the right to stay in the UK lawfully once the couple are married and then to apply from within the UK for a spouse visa. The holder of a spouse visa can take employment, and receive permanent residence (indefinite leave to remain, or ILR) after 5 years. And then they can apply for British nationality on the next day!  The holder of an MVV gets none of those things.
  
  But for some, it’s worth the difference in price to come to the UK, get married, and then use Article 8 (human rights) to remain in the UK.  When this happens, the path to ILR is extended to 10 years. Of course the applicant’s credibility is stained, but for lots of people this aspect doesn’t mean very much as they are just starting out in life.  I have been saying that it may be worth it for a very small number of cases, but 10 years is an awfully long time to hold out in a perilous immigration status with a new marriage. But if it works, it works, right?
  
  Well, sort of. But if the strategy is to get in cheaply and to use Article 8, then the SVV costs the same and leaves their credibility largely intact, or at least more so than the outright abuse of an MVV.
  
  Anyway, back to topic…
  
  Reading the refusal notice I find myself repeating the mantra that “ECO’s are not idiots”. Here we have two people who want to get married. Option 1 is to send the Brit to India, get married, and return to the UK. Option 2 is to send the Indian to the UK, get married, and (optimistically stated) return to India.  Any way you cut it Option 1 is somewhere between GBP 300 – GBP 400 cheaper than Option 2.  So what’s the rationale for wanting Option 2?  How is it that somebody with GBP 169 in the bank proposes to spend 300 – 400 pounds more to accomplish the same thing? Unless it’s to accomplish something different.  Or is the ECO not supposed to notice those things?  I suppose there’s an explanation that justifies an irrational plan like that, but they didn’t include it in the application.
  
  Next we come to the point Giorgio raised… they instructed a solicitor, this is great and part of my standing advice for over two decades.  So what in heaven’s name are they doing on the net asking random strangers for ideas and advice?  eh? EH?
  
  Finally (and perhaps mercifully) we arrive at my final nitpick.  In comments, the OP writes…
  
  
    He would be arriving in March, or the end of February (depending on if the application is approved) and we would leave for India together at the end of April/beginning of May as he has examinations in May
  
  
  Let’s do the arithmetic. 7 days residency required in order to give notice plus 28 – 70 days for the notice period (more if something is turned up).  That gives us somewhere between 35 to 77 days before the marriage can take place. Then add 3 – 5 days slippage to book the celebrant. His exams in India start in May.  The rest is left as an exercise for the reader.


Bottom line: as a UK citizen, use of this route is abusive, which a solicitor versed in UK immigration law will recognize. A second application in the same category will likely have the same result, a refusal, and repeated refusals affect him, not you. For your future together, you may need to rethink your short term plans so that your long term goals are not affected negatively.

9197,155283,Netherlands Visa Refusal on 17th March 2020,"This decision means what? 


  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the
  intended stay was not provided. The specific purpose for which the
  visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid
  before you arrive in the member state of destination. No other
  (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, of if
  it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the
  purpose of the stay. Therefore, your application for a visa is
  refused.

",155290,"To understand what it means, let's unpack the text of the decision.


  Sufficient justification for the purpose and circumstances of the intended stay was not provided.


That's one of the standard reasons for refusals provided in the Schengen Visa Code and other official documents. In general, it means that the consulate is not convinced you have a valid purpose for travel. There are many reasons why that might be and the rest is just an explanation of how they reached that conclusion.


  The specific purpose for which the visa was applied for is no longer valid or will cease to be valid before you arrive in the member state of destination.


This one is more specific and should help understand the first one. What this means is that the purpose for the trip you described in your original application might have been valid at some point in the past but it is not current anymore. Imagine you want to attend a conference but your application is delayed and the date of the conference has passed by the time the application is being assessed. Going to a conference is a perfectly valid purpose for a trip but if that specific conference has passed, you cannot possibly attend it and it's not a valid purpose for a visit anymore. 

It's difficult to say more without knowing more about your application but there are currently many restrictions on entry, travel and access to public areas across Europe due to the Covid-19 pandemic. So there are many legitimate trips to the Schengen area that are just not possible anymore. For example, if you applied for a visa to vacation in Italy, providing hotel bookings, etc. your trip does not have a purpose anymore as it won't be possible for you to stay at these hotels or visit any sights.


  No other (secondary) purpose was stated at the time of the application, [or] if it was, insufficient documentation was provided to demonstrate the purpose of the stay. 


A single journey can very well have several purposes. Even if one of them ceases to be valid, it doesn't mean that the trip is necessarily useless. But, in the judgment of the consular officer, you did not describe any other sufficient purpose for this journey. It could be a reference to some detail of your application or simply some boilerplate they add to all such decisions.

[Note: I changed “of“ into “or”. It makes more sense in this sentence; it could be a simple typo or a confusion with the Dutch word “of“, which does mean “or”.]

So what does it mean for you? The decision is negative, you won't get a visa and cannot travel at this time. An appeal does not seem to make sense to me so you will need to start a new application from scratch if you want to travel to the Schengen area in the future.

On the other hand, that's not the worst reason to be refused a visa. Nothing suggests the consular officer suspected that you might be lying (they can use a different phrasing - “the justification […] was not reliable” in that case) and they haven't expressed any doubt regarding your personal situation and willingness to abide by the rules. So a new application in a few months from now, when Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, seems like it would have good chances to be successful.
",Reasonable,"It should not be a problem.

The relevant condition for applying for a Schengen visa is just that you're legally resident in the coverage area for the consulate you're applying to. It is perfectly possible to be legally resident in the USA without having a current visa, and consulates in the USA know this well.

Another possible problem is that the consulate want to be sure you can actually leave the Schengen area when you say you will. That could have been a problem if your plan was to return to the US directly, since you don't have a visa that would allow you to board a plane.

But in your case your plan is to go to India when you leave the Schengen area, and presumably you already have all the paperwork you need for that (namely, a valid Indian passport), so there's no doubt that you will be able to do so.

If problems with getting your new US visa develop, it will be after you've left the Schengen area, so that's not a risk the Schengen consulate would care about.

You will still need to show that you have plans for your future that would seem more attractive than ""stay in Europe as an illegal immigrant"", but simply documenting a well-reasoned expectation that you will get an US visa when you reach India ought to take care of that.

According to the interior ministry (Coronavirus: Fragen und Antworten)

2 questions


Can I do a multi-day cycle tour? Mainly in the Saarland and Rheinland-Pfalz. Perhaps also Hessen. 
Can I camp in public spaces?


The questions are in the context of the Corona virus. In previous years in summer I have seen people camp out in the open along various rivers (Mosel, Rhine, Saale, Fulda). Myself I have camped in the open in the Blackforest, Erzgebirge and various other parts of Germany. But there was no Corona virus. I do not want to know if stealth / wild camping is allowed in normal times. 

I am also worried that with a touring bicycle (bags on rear and front racks), the authorities will immediately see that I am doing a tourist activity and not simply going to work.

(I am already legally in Germany.)
",155334,"TL;DR: You can, possibly, in some places, but it may not be a great idea.

Whether it is legal depends on the Bundesland (state) — to put it simply, the federal government has no authority in these matters, and each state put down their own rules. There are federal rules for entry into Germany, but these don't apply as you are already in the country.

Example rules

For example: In Saarland they implemented a lockdown (possibly due to their proximity to the heavy-hit regions of France): You may only leave your home due to ""important reasons"". On the other hand Rheinland-Pfalz has a ""contact prohibition"", which means that you can free to go wherever you want, as long as you are with no more than one other person. 

Also, individual cities have the right to be more restrictive.

Things change

Case numbers will rise in Germany and regulations may become more strict at any moment. In which case it may be difficult for you to go back home (also: Do not count on any restrictions being lifted until well after Easter — at best)

Infrastructure is shut down

However, even in Rheinland-Pfalz accommodations are not open for touristic purposes. This will include campgrounds. ""Wild"" camping is only regulated by the Länder, but generally there will be restrictions, and camping spots may be cordoned off. 

Also, most public services that are useful for travellers are also shut down.

Enforcement

It is difficult to say how things will be enforced. Generally there's no formal requirements in Germany, unlike in Italy or France. They will still stop and fine you if you blatantly flout the rules. My guess is that nobody will go and check for wild camping in the middle of nowhere, but they may check popular camping spots to make sure people don't congregate there.

Responsibility

Cycling alone is not really an (additional) risk, as long as you don't meet people. However, the question is if it is going to be a fun trip if you


can't go in places like the Saarland,
keep to yourself all the time,
have to find a remote spot to pitch your tent each night, and have no access to sanitary facilities,
have to bring/buy and cook your own food (there will be no restaurants).


Plus, Germany is a densely populated country — it will be hard to really be alone. And as soon as more than one person pitches their tent in one place, the police will likely see that as a ""congregation"" and break it up. 

In all honesty, it is probably a better idea to stay put in one place. If the local laws allow it, you can still go cycling and return to your home each night.

The government will generally not deport her for being out of status while her Extension of Status is pending. In addition, she does not accrue ""unlawful presence"" while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is pending, even if her I-94 is expired. If her Extension of Status is approved, she will be retroactively granted status from when her last status expired.

  and depart the United States immediately.
  
  In addition, any nonimmigrant visa in your passport granted in
  connection with your classification becomes void. Once your visa is

  determined by the U.S. Department of State).


If her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is denied, and her I-94 has expired, and she is still in the US on the date of the denial, she will start to accrue ""unlawful presence"" from the date of the denial. 

See AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(D)(iv):


  If a timely filed, non-frivolous request for EOS or COS is denied for
  cause, unlawful presence begins to accrue the day after the request is
  denied.


And 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii):


  b. DHS has interpreted ""period of stay authorized by the Secretary of
  Homeland Security,"" as used in this context, to include:
  
  (4) For aliens who have applied for extension of stay or change of
  nonimmigrant classification and who have remained in the United States
  after expiration of the From I-94 while awaiting DHS's decision, the
  entire period of the pendency of the application, provided that: 
  
  (a) the alien does not work unlawfully while the application is
  pending and did not work unlawfully prior to filing the application;
  and
  
  (b) the alien did not otherwise fail to maintain his or her status
  prior to the filing of the application (unless the application is
  approved at the discretion of USCIS and the failure to maintain status
  is solely a result of the expiration of the Form I-94), and further
  provided either:
  
  (i) [...]; or
  
  (ii) if the application was denied or the alien departed while the
  application was still pending, that the application was timely filed
  and nonfrivolous.


""Unlawful presence"" doesn't cause a ban unless she leaves the US after accrues more than 180 days of ""unlawful presence"". So she shouldn't have to worry about a ban as long as she leaves within a reasonable amount of time after she learns about the denial.

The other consequence of her being still in the US when her Extension of Status is denied if her I-94 is expired, is that INA 222(g) is triggered, which means the visa she used to enter the US is automatically voided, and she would have to apply for US visas from her country of nationality from then on.

Also, USCIS has a policy where they will issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) to people after an I-539 denial if they are unlawfully present after the denial, although I am not sure whether they are still doing that during the COVID-19 outbreak. According to this teleconference, they will wait for a 33-day period (the period to file a Motion to Reopen or Reconsider) after the denial before they issue the NTA, so this basically means your mother should try to leave within 33 days of a denial.

On the other hand, if she leaves the US while her timely-filed, non-frivolous Extension of Status application is still pending (i.e. before it is approved or denied), she does not accrue any ""unlawful presence"", and her visa is not voided.

See AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):


  Departure from the United States while a request for EOS or COS is
  pending, does not subject an alien to the 3-year, 10-year, or
  permanent bar, if he or she departs after the expiration of Form I-94,
  Arrival/Departure Record unless the application was frivolous,
  untimely, or the individual had worked without authorization.


And the 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(1)(b)(4)(b)(ii) passage quoted previously.

And it does not void her visa under INA 222(g), according to 9 FAM 302.1-9(B)(1)(c)(4)(B):


  [...] In addition, if an alien departs after the date on the Form I-94
  passes, but before his or her application for extension or change of
  status has been decided by USCIS, they must be subject to a blanket
  exemption from INA 222(g), if the application was filed in a ""timely
  manner"" and is ""nonfrivolous"" in nature.  You may consider an
  application nonfrivolous if it is not, on its face, a groundless
  excuse for the applicant to remain in the United States to engage in
  activities incompatible with his or her status.  Posts may be
  satisfied that an alien filed in a timely manner using evidence such
  as a record in USCIS Person Centric Query Service (PCQS) or the dated
  receipt or canceled check from USCIS for the payment of the
  application fee to extend or change status together with evidence of
  the expiration of the alien's legal status.


The meaning of being timely-filed and non-frivolous are described in AFM chapter 40.9.2(b)(3)(C):


  [...]
  
  The requirement that the application was timely may be established
  through the submission of evidence of the date the previously
  authorized stay expired, together with a copy of a dated filing
  receipt, a canceled check payable to USCIS for the EOS or COS
  application, or other credible evidence of a timely filing.
  
  [...]
  
  To be considered non-frivolous, the application must have an arguable
  basis in law and fact, and must not have been filed for an improper
  purpose (such as to prolong one’s stay to pursue activities
  inconsistent with one’s status).
  
  In determining whether an EOS or COS application was non-frivolous,
  DOS has instructed consular posts that it is not necessary to make a
  determination that USCIS would have ultimately ruled in favor of the
  alien.


And 9 FAM 302.11-3(B)(5)(b-c):


  b. [...] Therefore, for all cases involving potential inadmissibility
  under INA 212(a)(9)(B) whether under the three-year bar of
  212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) or the 10-year bar of INA 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II), DHS
  has decided to consider all time during which an application for
  extension of stay (EOS) or change of nonimmigrant status (COS) is
  pending to be a period of stay authorized by the Secretary of Homeland
  Security provided:
  
  (1) The application was filed in a timely manner; i.e., before the
  expiration date of the Form I-94, Arrival and Departure Record;
  
  (2) The application was ""nonfrivolous""; and
  
  (3) The alien has not engaged in unauthorized employment (whether
  before or after April 1, 1997).
  
  [...]
  
  c. To be considered ""nonfrivolous"" the consular officer must find that
  the application had an arguable basis in law and fact and must not
  have been filed for an improper purpose (e.g., as a groundless excuse
  for the applicant to remain in activities incompatible with his or her
  status).  It is not necessary to determine that the DHS would have
  approved the application for it to be considered nonfrivolous.


So the question is whether her application of Extension of Status is ""frivolous"" or not. Note that it is possible for an application to be ""non-frivolous"" even if USCIS is likely to deny it; it just needs to have an ""arguable basis in law and fact"" and not be ""filed for an improper purpose"".

In my (non-professional) opinion, an application of Extension of Status for the reason of not being able to return to her home country to due COVID-19 flight bans is not frivolous. In the USCIS page on Special Situations, it mentions that for applications of Extension of Status and Change of Status, USCIS will take into consideration how special situations prevented your departure.

9232,156392,Getting refunded for a flight which I'll be prevented from boarding,"In 2019 I booked a flight ticket with SAS to Svalbard. Unfortunately Covid19 happened.

My ticket is from a flight outside the nordic countries, with a layover in Oslo.

I'll be prevented from entering Norway, since I'm not a resident. Moreover, even if I was already in Norway right now, I'd be prevented from boarding the flight from Oslo to Longyearbyen, since Svalbard  also separately restricted travel.

To add to the complexity, when I tried to book this ticket, SAS doesn't offer a flight with a single layover. All of the flights I found have a further layover in Stavanger, Stockholm, Copenhagen... even if SAS offers direct flights to Oslo! The solution I found was to book with a travel agent which sold me a ticket with a single layover.

So, SAS has a page for Covid19 information, with links to a search tool (a bit buggy and annoying to use) to check cancelled and confirmed flights, I haven't been able to confirm it for sure, but the closer we are to the departure date (it's less than 10 days from now), it seems that the less likely it'll be for it to be cancelled.

I have the option of REBOOKING FREE OF CHARGE, unfortunately The rebooking can be made only once. and due to the current uncertainty, it's really difficult to pick another sensible date on which to plan my trip (no idea when Norway and Svalbard will reopen to visitors).

In theory, I have the option to exchange my flight ticket for a voucher, that way I'd have the option to defer choosing the new date, which would suit me much better. Unfortunately The voucher is valid for bookings made directly with SAS (not for bookings made by travel agents).

I already contacted my travel agent 6 days ago. They ask not to call, and contact them via their ticketing system only for trips in the next 4 weeks. Unfortunately, both messages I sent them have been replied with an automated reply which suggests to call them on the phone (phone which only has a recorded message, saying that they are unable to take calls due to the huge volume of requests).

So, it seems that I'm stuck. I was thinking that given that in normal circumstances I have right to travel to norway (being an EEA citizen), if I'm denied boarding I should be able to at least hope for compensation according to EU regulation 261.  Though it seems there's an exception  For safety, security or health reasons, which usually is for different kinds of concerns, but it might be applied to a blanket ban on non-residents due to Covid19.
Regardless if that exception happens, I'd have to actually attempt boarding (be at the airport on time) to actually claim compensation. I could do that, but that seems less than ideal:


I'm social distancing, and I'd rather avoid a needless trip to the airport
As described above, I don't know if I should realistically expect compensation (maybe you can help me here)
I'd have to hope that the airline would really not let me board (given that I'd then be stuck in Norway without a flight to come back immediately), though I guess I can go past the gate and then turn back before entering the plane.


I guess that if the worst thing that happens to me during this pandemic is that I'll lose out on the money for this flight ticket, that's still pretty good, all things considered. Before giving up on it though, maybe you have some suggestion on how to able to be refunded?
",156463,"If someone has an answer to the general question, that's still welcome, but to provide an update on my specific situation:

It seems that things will resolve for the best: the airline ended up cancelling the flight, and the travel agent wrote me that they'll go ahead with the refund process.

I've actually only received automated emails from the agent, and I've been unable to speak with anyone. Otoh I've actually been able to speak with someone from the airline, so this experience is persuading me to try even harder in the future to avoid booking via a travel agent.
",Reasonable,"There is a possibility you will have to pay, as I am reading on TripAdvisor they are very strict on bags:


  Etihad is extremely strict at check in on carry on baggage size, it's weight, and also the weight of checked baggage, so much so that at Abu Dhabi there are scales and areas for passengers to re-distribute contents across bags to balance weight variations.


Also, from this question:


  Airlines do weigh checked baggage and that is the most important measurement, actual dimensions are almost never measured for 'normal' luggage. Even when they do, small differences are hardly ever a problem, especially if the overall dimensions are good.
  There is, however, no guaranty a specific agent may measure and give you a harder time.
  At this time there is no tradition of measuring luggage out of sight of the passenger and coming back to them with complains.
  
  If the rules change in the future, you might be stuck with a piece of luggage that can not be used on flights.

After that, he came to Germany (Munich) because he had relatives here and went to the immigration office (KVR) to extend his visa. They told him that he can extend his visa but he should provide insurance. After providing insurance the immigration office got closed. He has sent several emails but he hasn't got any response yet. His visa is expired now and we are so worried about this issue. Is it possible for him to go back to Iran with an expired visa in this situation? The border police say that it's not possible and going back is an emergency now for him.

Do you have any suggestions for this situation?
",156407,"The visa status should not prevent him from leaving Germany. Under normal circumstances overstays may be punished, but for people who leave on their own after a few days that would at most be a fine. That makes the response by the border police puzzling. Are you sure nothing was lost in translation?

The city of Munich writes:


Contact the KVR before the visa expires. He has done that.
He will receive a certification which is valid until the KVR reopens. That hasn't happened yet.
If there is no reply yet, he should send a mail with scans of 


Passport and visa
A confirmation of the hotel or host where he is staying.
A proof that departure is impossible. (They don't say what that is.)

So it seems that he did everything required and the city administration can't keep up. 

He should take care to get everything documented properly so that there are no problems with the next Schengen visa application.

We neglected to purchase travel insurance when we booked it at the start of 2020 (we've learnt from this mistake). We have already started paying the balance on this trip.

So now we are looking at purchasing travel insurance but we are concerned that the Covid-19 lockdown currently in the UK, will invalidate any insurance we take out now. The optimistic estimates put the end of the lockdown around the 15th June.

Is it worth us taking out the insurance now to protect our existing deposit/holiday or is likely that all insurance policies purchased now will be invalidated if there is an extension to the lockdown?

Any guidance on this is much appreciated.
",156413,"Generally speaking it is worth considering cover now for a future trip, but it's unlikely that a standard travel insurance policy regulated by the UK will cover you for Covid-19 related problems. So far as I'm aware, none will.

9276,156488,Getting refunded for a non-refundable booking due to the hotel closure because of the COVID-19 situation (Netherlands),"I made a non-refundable hotel room booking through the hotel website. The hotel is located in the Netherlands.

Two days ago, a hotel manager informed me that they close the hotel for a certain period that included the period of my stay due to the Coronavirus, and that is why they were forced to move my reservation to another date. However, I do not want to move my reservation and would like to get the money back because I did not cancel my reservation, so I informed the hotel about it. The hotel, however, states that they are forced to move my reservation to another date as I made a non-refundable booking.

I checked the official website of the government of the Netherlands as was advised here and the rules of the hotel on their website but have not found anything on this matter. The rules, however, are on Dutch, so I could misunderstand or skip something (I do not speak Dutch at all).
As far as I understand the situation based on John's question and answers, I am entitled to a refund. Are there some documents that I can cite to the hotel to get a refund?

P.S. My sister booked the same hotel for the same dates (non-refundable hotel room booking as well) but through Booking. She was able to get a refund after several e-mails. However, she made the booking from Russia (the Netherlands deny the entry for foreigners having a tourist visa), while I did it from Germany where I have permanent residency.
",156489,"Did you contact them?

They try to move the bookings, so that they have the money (liquidity) to pay employers. They could be in trouble if all clients will ask refund (there could ask government for help).

But you booking is a contract, so they are required to fulfill the contract on the data you both agreed, or they must refund you.  Just they try (maybe with a better offer) to keep booking (and money) for a later period.

The website booking.com doesn't get money from you (you will pay the hotel), so they have no really interest to have the ""move booking"" default.

So try to contact them, and think: do you want to book in a later date? In that case you may try to get a very good offer. But they must refund you.

The last step, it is to contact your credit card, and get the money back from them, because you were charged a service they will not offer you.

Or otherwise when the soonest available flight changes its date?



I have crossposted the question at:


Quora

",156493,"Assuming you want to fly home (and you should only be trying to fly home), your best bet is the consular staff of your country. For example, various Canadian government agencies are tweeting about flights to Canada from specific airports. Here's a snapshot of the feed of travel.gc.ca:



In addition to following your country (and subsets of it like the ""Canada in Lebanon"" and ""Canada in Singapore"" accounts you see in the screenshot) you should have registered with your government so they can email, call or text you, and you should probably have called your embassy or consulate for advice about how to get home. 

If you aren't trying to get home, but are trying to reach a relative or someone else who really needs you, these same sources are the ones that are likely to help you. If you think your travel need isn't urgent enough to get an embassy involved, then stop trying to travel. People are desperately trying to get home, to reunite families, to get out while they can. If you've just always wanted to see a particular place, now is not the time.

Bottom line: make sure at least one qualified human who is connected to your target country knows you're trying to get there, then start monitoring the heck out of airlines, airports, and those embassies and consulates on all the social media you can think of, and getting yourself on group chats and multi emails and facebook groups, so you'll be notified when there's a chance to go.

9282,156517,"Air Serbia reneged on an offer of compensation, citing Covid-19. Is this OK?","Someone I know booked a return flight on Air Serbia from Vienna to Podgorica (Montenegro) via Belgrade, departing on 6 March 2020 and returning on 14 March 2020.  On 10 March 2020, Air Serbia cancelled the return leg from Belgrade to Vienna without explanation; the passenger contacted Air Serbia by phone, who rebooked them on the next available flight, 24 hours later than the original return date.  Air Serbia told them on the phone that reasonable transport, meal, and accommodation costs for the unplanned overnight stay in Belgrade would be compensated.

According to Air Serbia's statement of passenger rights*, the EU Regulation 261/2004 on flight compensation is integrated into Serbian law, so we assume that the passenger is entitled not only to the costs for the stay in Belgrade, but also €250 in compensation for the cancelled flight.

The passenger accordingly made a claim for compensation (both the overnight expenses and the €250 cancellation award) using Air Serbia's online form*, including all the relevant travel information and documentation (receipts, etc.).  Air Serbia just now rejected the claim as follows:


  Thank you for your patience while the claim relating to your journey from BEG to PRG on 14.3.2020 was processed.
  
  After carefully reviewing your claim, I regret to inform you that we are not able to provide compensation in this case. This decision was reached taking into account the specific circumstances of your case, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Please note that the decision is final.
  
  We’re sorry that our service on 14.3.2020 did not meet your expectations and hope that we can look forward to welcoming you on-board an Air Serbia flight in the future.


We are skeptical about this rejection for the following reasons:


On the phone, Air Serbia had already promised compensation at least for the transport, accommodation, and meals in Belgrade.
Air Serbia cancelled the flight before the governments of Serbia and Austria had imposed any restrictions on foreign travel relating to the coronavirus pandemic.
At no time before now had Air Serbia indicated that the cancellation was due to the pandemic.
According to the answer to another Covid-19–related question here (May I get a refund for a flight cancelled because of COVID-19?), ""under EU rules you always get a refund"".


We would therefore like answers to the following:


Under Serbian or EU law (whichever is applicable in our case), is the passenger in fact entitled to compensation in this case?
If the answer to the previous question is ""yes"", then to what enforcement body can the passenger appeal Air Serbia's final decision?  The EU helpfully provides a list of national enforcement bodies for EC 261/2004, but Serbia is not on this list.  If there's no national enforcement body in Serbia, can the passenger appeal to the one in Austria, given that she bought the ticket and is resident there?




* Note that due to Air Serbia's broken website, you may need to follow that link twice before the correct page appears.  It seems that first-time visitors to the website are always redirected to its home page.
",156522,"The €250 compensation doesn't apply in extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline's control. While it's not certain that this applies, it's highly likely now during Covid-19.

However, extra expenses (accommodation, food) are to be reimbursed, per Article 9 of the EC261 regulation.

So contact them again and mention this (of course, attach the receipts). Tell them that Article 9 of EC261 applies regardless of any extraordinary circumstances.

And if you want to be dead certain if extraordinary cirumstances apply or not (i.e. whether or not the €250 compensation is due), ask a firm such as Claimcompass to investigate it. It costs nothing, and they have sophisticated resources for checking things, but if they find compensation is due, they'll keep 35% of the amount for themselves.

Of course, the chances of approval of an extension of status goes down with each additional extension. The fact that she has a US citizen spouse in the US also may make it likely that she will be denied for immigrant intent. But at least an application for extension of status (filed before her status expires) will allow her to stay while the application is pending, which can be several months, so it will buy her more time.

I tried to contact my insurance company but they did not answer. I was also in a rush as my accommodation has ordered me to leave, but I do not have proof of this in writing unfortunately.

I am now trying to claim these extra fees back from my insurance company but they are stating that because the FCO (UK Govt) did not announce non essential travel until the 17th March I have no claim. 

The exact wording in my travel policy for curtailment is:


  If you have to curtail your trip as a result of the Travel Advice Unit of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office
  (FCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) or similar body recommending evacuation from the country or
  specific area in which you are travelling, providing the directive came into force after you purchased this
  insurance and after you have left your Country of Residence to commence the trip (whichever is the later).


And the reply from my insurance company was:


  Unfortunately, from the information you provided, it would appear as shown above, the reason you abandoned your trip is not included in the specified incidents for which cover is provided under the policy. 
  You paid the fee to amend your flight on the 15th of March, however, the FCO advice to travel to/from France came into force on the 17th of March. We are therefore unable to consider your claim further.


This is really cheeky of them and they clearly don't want to pay out. I need some advice on the fact that I was already abroad at the time of this announcement - the host country has ordered everything to close and therefore my trip will be cut short. 

What points can I argue that my policy is in fact valid and I am due a refund?
Thanks
",156642,"The wording states 


...or similar body recommending evacuation from the country



So although the FCO might not have issued advice until later, the fact that the French government ordered all resorts closed should be sufficient.

So you need to find this advice from French government sources online, write back to your insurance company and be polite but firm and point this out to them.  Keep your letter short and to the point and state that you had no choice and the country was being locked down and all non-residents ordered to leave.
Therefore, according to the T&amp;Cs of your policy you expect the claim to be honoured and paid in full ASAP.

Also point them to this statement from the Financial Conduct Authority:
https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/insurance-and-coronavirus-our-expectations

And this:
https://www.choose.co.uk/news/2020/covid-19-insurance-policy-advice-government/

State that you are disappointed with their behaviour and are considering complaining to the insurance ombudsman.  And will pursue the claim further if they do not pay.

If they still refuse, then your only option is to complain to the ombudsman and/or pursue them in the small claims court.
",Reasonable,"I got mugged when living in France. The phrase I remember them using during that experience was ""vide les poches"" (empty your pockets).

However, I'd agree with the comments on the original question, the fact that someone is trying to mug you should be apparent regardless of your competence in the language. Beggars will be persistent, sure, but it's very different to an actual ""aggression"".

",156647,"You can't just 'cancel because of coronavirus'. If the airline is still listing the flight then you can only cancel on whatever terms you agreed to when you booked.

If your ticket is fully refundable then you can cancel and rebook, if you can actually get the refund. Many airlines are refusing to pay refunds at present. 

More likely, there will be some penalty for cancelling, which could be part or all of the fare you've paid. Even with the price reduction, it's likely that you'll end up paying more overall.

If you're hoping to get a full refund (as cash or voucher) then you'll have to wait until the airline cancels the flight, in which case there will be no flight to rebook onto.
",Reasonable,"A couple of points 
1 - unlike in France and Germany it is FREE to reserve a seat when you buy your ticket. No additional cost. If you do not get a seat you have reserved you can claim a FULL refund. The cost of your ticket therefore DOES INCLUDE A RESERVED SEAT. it's just down to you to actually reserve it
...

2 - The National Conditions of Travel are the MINIMUM standard and what all train operators have to apply. Most train operators go well beyond that and I can't think of anyone who wouldn't refund the difference in cost for first class passengers travelling in a declassified coach.

3 - yes it's a form you need to fill put but how else would you do it? it's like saying you want to return a dress and getting arsey because they want you to take it back to the shop.

I have a Swedish passport, so I can enter Vietnam for 14 days without a visa.

Is it possible to extend that for another 14 days or less somewhere near Saigon? Or at all?
",155343,"I found that your concern has not been answer at all. So, I don't know whether you have been to Vietnam with your 15 days visa exemption or not. But as I know, via this link https://www.vietnam-visa.com/vietnam-visa-extension/, a visa exemption can be extended for up to 3 months. Although now, due to COVID 19, Vietnam is temporarily closed to all incoming foreigners, I hope this piece of information will help in case you wish to visit Vietnam in the future with visa exemption.
",Reasonable,"According to Rome2Rio the cheapest flight between Ukraine and Japan is 270€ single, from Boryspil (kbp) to Chübu Centrair (ngo).

To find these flights you'll have to search regularly as prices can change every minute.

If you're under 26 you may be able to find youth tickets, which you can't find using normal flight search engines but only at the carriers own websites.
